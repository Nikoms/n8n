but if I told you that getting promoted in Tech has almost nothing to do with your technical skills over the last year I've worked closely with nearly 500 Tech professionals to help them get their next promotion I've noticed that there's a single trait that separates people that struggle with getting to the next level and those that don't if you think it's their technical skills you're wrong it's also not their leadership abilities it's not even their communication Styles it's something far more fundamental and once you know what it is makes the promotion progress so much easier because you're not waiting around for stuff that you don't control to happen in this video I'll reveal what it is and give you three concrete ways to leverage this new understanding to get you that Tech promotion faster than you thought was humanly possible my name is Steve Winn and I'm a former Amazon principal software engineer I've risen through every software development level there is and I've sat on promotion panels for every level up to an including L7 principal engineer I was a bar raiser bar raiser mentor and conducted more than 850 technical interviews I taught making great hiring decisions and the SD functional interviewing course I've trained thousands of amazonians personally on how to conduct technical interviews and determine what level to extend offers I quit my cushy job of 18 years last year to help as many people as I can level up their Tech careers the reason is simple I can only help so many people within the closed doors of big Tech in real talk I believe the world needs more promoted senior Engineers it's a crime that there's such an asymmetry between employers and employees the people that keep the business running companies hold all the cards but you the worker is the one bringing in all the value it shouldn't be this way imagine you're in the world's most frustrating ride share you and five other people need to get home your house is literally right there you can almost see it through the window you trap on the driver's shoulder hey my house is right there could you drop me off next the driver smiles and says sure we do and then drives right past your house not just a little past we're talking three neighborhoods away to drop off someone who lives in the complete opposite direction you try again we just passed my house back there oh yeah the driver says don't worry we'll Circle back the night goes on you watch as the driver takes the most illogical route possible you get stuck in traffic someone gets dropped off 45 minutes away and they could have been first another passenger gets taken home despite sleeping in the back seat two more people get into the car your house you keep passing it over and over each time you get hopeful each time you're ready to get out each time right past it that sounds insane doesn't it but this is how most people approach a promotion you might not even tap on the driver's shoulder you might just quietly wait until it's your turn you're sitting in a passenger seat watching others get what they want it makes perfect sense for you to be next but you're waiting for someone else to decide when it's your turn but here's the thing you were ushered into this ride share there's no reason why you can't get out and get your own car it's just nobody told you that that was an option the default mode is for you to wait your turn however arbitrary that is and that's the mental shift that separates the people that have no problems getting promoted versus the people that stay stuck for years the people that get promoted take their promotions the people that are waiting for their turn always wait longer than they need to so what does it mean to get into the driver's seat let me tell you what it doesn't mean it doesn't mean waiting for your manager to notice how hard you're working it doesn't mean hoping someone else sees your late nights and it definitely doesn't mean silently fixing everything that's broken while waiting for recognition the idea that you need to wait your turn is even baked into the way that we describe promotions we say I got a promotion or even I was given a promotion these are passive constructions that only benefit employers they imply that the company was gracious enough to give them to you that they're the active party people do get a promotion by surprise but it's rare and it's usually for lower levels for everybody else you have to take a promotion but how do you do it I'll give you three things that you can do right now to make tangible progress on getting to the level that you're already performing at getting those bigger scope projects and of course getting that big salary bump that comes with your next tech promotion so let's talk about your manager you know that a terrible boss makes work a living hell and a great boss makes you look forward to going into to the office but your next promotion isn't about being buddy buddy it's not about getting coffee or knowing their kids' names it's about something much more fundamental let me tell you a story about my own career at Amazon I was a senior engineer and I knew I was ready for the next step my manager would say all of the right things you're doing great work Steve you're definitely on track then came promotion season I needed him to submit a promotion request to start the process simple task right every day for weeks I asked him about it every day he'd say I'm working on it every day my stomach would twist a little tighter the deadline was getting closer don't worry he'd say got this then the deadline passed just like that no document submitted no promotion possible for another 6 months I remember sitting at my desk that day I felt like someone had punched my gut I realized that the promotion that was so important to me just wasn't urgent to him he was that ride share driver if I had known then what I know now I would have gotten out of the passenger seat and gotten my own car but I didn't know my worth high performance senior Engineers that know how to navigate and deliver big projects are valuable I could have transferred teams internally or found a new company but I didn't even consider that as an option I was too concerned with the tech stack and the product we were building I gave work everything I had and this is how they treated me that's when I learned the first rule of taking control of your career you need to make your intentions Crystal Clear not hints not suggestions not hoping that your good work speaks for itself it doesn't it Whispers I'm talking about sitting down with your manager during your next oneon-one and saying these exact words I want to get promoted and i' like to work with you to understand where I'm at and what it would take to make that happen now one of three things is going to happen after that one they'll actively support you Perfect Two they'll have some concerns and feedback but they're willing to work with you that's workable because you're not demanding a promotion you're asking what it would take three they'll resist or deflect or postpone the conversation if it's one of the first two awesome you're on track but if it's the the third one you have to make some choices you could remain passive and stay in the ride share if you want to take your promotion though you have more options you can try to repair the relationship and if that doesn't work you need to find a supportive manager because here's the brutal truth you can be the most talented engineer in the world but if your manager isn't willing to work with you on growth or give opportunities to prove yourself your promotion is never going to happen now I know some of you are thinking Steve I'm not comfortable having that direct conversation with my manager maybe you're worried that you'll seem pushy maybe you were raised in a culture where you're expected to stay in your lane and it feels disrespectful maybe you're afraid they'll say no but your discomfort with this conversation is costing you years of growth the thing about managers is that they're busy and they're not mind readers in fact many of them are actually waiting for you to show some initiative if you're worried about broaching the topic of promotion directly then you can talk about career growth instead of promotion since that's a stepping stone say this to them instead in our next oneon-one I'd like to talk about my career growth but I don't want to Blindside you in our next chat can we go over how I'm performing against expectations and when you go to the meeting have a spreadsheet of all the at level and Next Level criteria ready to go you can just splitz through the list and have a conversation that actually progresses your career because you don't get anything that you don't ask for have you ever seen a mid dude with an insanely gorgeous woman and thought to yourself how did that happen it happened because someone asked an uncomfortable question if you want something ask for it you have to go and get it if you don't make your intentions Crystal Clear by having that uncomfortable conversation it's never going to happen don't worry about writing any of this down I've made all of the videos to my paid program speedrun to promotion free to the public and all of this stuff is in there I used to charge up to $10,000 for access to these videos in addition you'll also get access to my 5-day promotion challenge where by the end you'll have a fully formed and detailed promotion plan there's some other goodies in there as well and you can't beat the price link to sign up is in the description let me tell you about Ben he was one of the strongest coders I've ever worked with at Amazon give him any technical problem debugging a race condition performance optimizations you name it he'd Solve IT elegantly and quickly he was a code machine everyone wanted Ben on their team but he'd been stuck at senior for 6 years he couldn't understand why look at my impact he'd say look how much code I've written look at all the things we shipped so then I invited him to sit on some system design reviews with a group of principal Engineers we were talking about a system that wasn't his is so not the same stack but in the same ecosystem I'll never forget watching his face during that meeting we didn't discuss implementation details or coding patterns we were debating things like which distributed databases should we select and why what was the team's long-term caching strategy how would we handle 100x the number of requests without affecting the availability of the broader system the conversation was fast and furious ping ponging to the different principal Engineers how could we maintain data coherence globally while serving traffic from many geographic regions how does this affect our capacity planning for a Q4 across the organization were we using the right type of compute for our workload how is this going to affect our big product initiatives for the upcoming year after the meeting Ben looked at me and he said something I'll never forget I've been playing a different game see Ben had been trying to get to the next level by being an even better senior engineer writing even better code delivering a ton of Team projects doing it faster but that's not how promotion works and that's my point to get to the next level you need to make an argument that you deserve more scope not that you're amazing at your current scope that you're ready for bigger scope Ben was trying to be the world's best technical Problem Solver when he needed to show that he could think about broader distributed systems and architectures leading cross functional projects with many stakeholders and delivering business impact at a broader scale taking your promotion means growing in areas where you might feel uncomfortable at first because if you were already there and had the skills you needed then you'd already be playing at that next level that bigger game most companies have Rollin level guidelines that outline exactly what it takes to get to the next level you should take the list of Next Level criteria and go over it with your manager to see where you're at but expect that there are items that you're either missing or require significant work to achieve don't ignore them in favor of doing more things that you're already good at instead recognize that you have gaps that will limit your effectiveness at the next level and no amount of doing more of the same is going to overcome that the next levels are a different game and your promotion is an argument that you'll be able to play that game you've got tickets to the big concert you open your ride share app 2 hours before the show surge pricing is in effect $65 for the ride that's too much you think I'll wait 30 minutes for prices to go down 30 minutes later it's $85 and The weit Time Is Now 45 minutes more time passes $110 and cars are showing up an hour away you kept waiting for the right moment the right price and now you might miss the show entirely this is exactly what happens with promotions engineers look at what it takes to level up the scope the responsibility the visibility all of the extra work they think to themselves that feels like too much right now I'll wait until I'm more ready and that's my point you're waiting for something to happen unnecessarily don't postpone yourself there's a lot of advice floating around out there that you shouldn't focus on a promotion because you'll only gravitate to doing things that will get you that promotion the thing called promotion driven development focus on being a better engineer they'll say but it's easy for them to say because those people already have the promotion they wanted it's like when a rich person says money doesn't make you happy or solve all of your problems you shouldn't Focus so much on it well then give me your money if it doesn't help you two things can be true at the same time you can want to get promoted and be a better engineer don't let other people tell you to wait to postpone yourself managers in particular are really good at deflecting and delaying how about you finish this project off and then we'll talk about it or we've got a big initiative coming down the pipe next year I think that would be a good promotion project for you or that famous line don't worry about promotion why don't you just focus on being a better engineer and we can talk about it later all of this talk is designed to postpone your growth because growing people is extra work to put in a promotion packet means doing a lot of extra things for them maybe they don't feel like you're ready but don't want to have that tough conversation with you why have a difficult conversation now if they can kick the can down the road and so you wait until the next quarter to start the next half to start next year to start minana later but just like surge pricing the cost of waiting only goes up the requirements don't get easier the competition doesn't decrease and that sliding window of your work and achievements it keeps moving your achievements from a year ago are fading from view just like those available cars disappearing on your ride share map I worked with the senior engineer that's now a principal at Amazon on this exact issue he was waiting for a big project delivery even though he had a record of delivering big cross functional projects but then the project got canned he got reor he got a new manager another big project got assigned to him him I'll put my packet in after this project is launched and we can collect metrics on impact I convinced him to apply anyway actually I bugged him every day until he did it there was no downside for him to put this packet in if he didn't make it at least it would confirm that he was on the right track you know what happened he got one of the hardest promotions at Amazon on his first try he said Steve why didn't I put my packet in 2 years ago I estimate he lost about a million dollar in compensation because he didn't put it in years before and that I made him about a million dollar or more by pushing him to put his packet in being impatient with action means requesting that ride now even if the price feels a bit High even if it's inconvenient even if you're not totally comfortable you bought tickets to the concert go because while you're waiting for the perfect moment you may miss that thing that you truly want the thing that you deserve book The Ride Now start your promotion Journey now let your intentions be Crystal Clear if promotion is the thing that you want it might feel uncomfortable it might feel cringe but that's so much better than watching your window of opportunity shrink while you wait for a perfect moment that doesn't exist take your promotion if you found this video helpful and you're trying to get to senior engineer none of this matters unless you have more situational awareness check out this video about three reasons why your promotion to senior engineer isn't happening

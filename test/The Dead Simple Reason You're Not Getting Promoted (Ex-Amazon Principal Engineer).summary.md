# The Dead Simple Reason You're Not Getting Promoted (Ex-Amazon Principal Engineer)

## TLDR;

- Getting promoted in Tech is largely unrelated to technical skills, leadership, or communication alone.
- The key to promotion is taking control of your career by clearly communicating your intention to be promoted.
- Waiting passively for recognition or promotion from a manager often leads to long delays.
- Have a direct conversation with your manager about your promotion goals and what is needed to achieve them.
- If your manager is unsupportive, you may need to seek a different manager or team.
- Promotion requires demonstrating readiness for broader scope and responsibility, not just excelling at current tasks.
- Do not postpone applying for promotions; the optimal moment may never come, and waiting only increases opportunity costs.
- Use company guidelines to identify gaps in your skills relative to the next level and work to address them.
- Take proactive and sometimes uncomfortable steps to navigate the promotion process, including asking for help and clarifying expectations.
- Promotion is an active process of claiming your next level, not a passive gift from the employer.

### Introduction
Getting promoted in Tech often feels like waiting for a miracle, but what if I told you that your technical skills, communication style, or leadership abilities are not the main factors? After working with nearly 500 Tech professionals, I found a fundamental trait separates those who get promoted from those who don't.

### The Ride Share Analogy
Imagine being stuck in a ride share with multiple stops, your house just steps away, yet the driver keeps passing it. This frustrating scenario parallels how many people passively wait for promotions—watching others move ahead while they simply wait their turn.

### Taking Control: Getting in the Driver's Seat
Waiting for your manager to notice your hard work or fix issues silently won't get you promoted. Promotions are not passive—phrases like "I was given a promotion" imply it's a gift from employers, which is rarely the case beyond entry-level roles. You must actively take your promotion.

### Clear Intentions Are Crucial
The most important step is to make your promotion goals crystal clear to your manager. Schedule a one-on-one, say explicitly, "I want to get promoted and would like to work with you to understand what it takes." This conversation leads to one of three outcomes: active support, feedback with willingness to help, or resistance. If resisted, consider repairing the relationship or finding a supportive manager.

### Overcoming Discomfort
If you're hesitant to bring up promotion directly, frame the conversation around career growth and performance expectations. Come prepared with your role’s level criteria to guide the discussion. Remember, managers are busy and not mind readers—they often wait for you to show initiative.

### Playing a Bigger Game: From Senior to Next Level
One common mistake is focusing solely on excelling at your current level. Promotions require proving you can handle bigger scope and impact. For example, Ben was an exceptional coder but stuck at senior level. His breakthrough came when he demonstrated understanding of system-wide architecture and cross-functional leadership.

### Use Level Guidelines and Address Gaps
Most companies have clear guidelines for roles. Review these with your manager to identify and work on any gaps. Simply doing more of the same won't get you promoted; you must grow into new skills aligned with the next level.

### Don’t Postpone Your Promotion Journey
Waiting for the "perfect moment" to apply—like the lowest surge pricing for a ride—or after "one more project" often results in missed opportunities. The cost of waiting increases, your achievements fade, and competition doesn’t lessen. Apply proactively even if conditions aren't perfect.

### Real Impact: A Story of Lost Opportunity
An engineer at Amazon waited years to apply despite a strong track record. After I convinced him to submit his promotion packet, he succeeded immediately but lamented the years and compensation lost by waiting so long.

### Final Advice
Be impatient with action. Book that ride now, have the uncomfortable conversations, show your intentions clearly, and play the bigger game. Being proactive will accelerate your promotion journey and unlock the larger scope and rewards you deserve.

### Closing
If you're aiming to become a senior engineer or beyond, situational awareness about the promotion process is critical. Check out additional resources on why promotions may be delayed to sharpen your approach and win your next career level.

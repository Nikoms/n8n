### Introduction: The Truth About Tech Promotions
Getting promoted in tech is not primarily about technical skills, leadership abilities, or communication styles. Despite working with nearly 500 tech professionals, the key factor distinguishing those who get promoted from those who struggle is far more fundamental — taking control of the promotion process yourself.

### The Ride Share Analogy: Taking Control of Your Promotion
Imagine being in a rideshare with your house just around the corner, yet the driver keeps passing it to drop off others first. This frustrating experience mirrors the common approach to promotions: waiting passively for your turn. Most people wait quietly, expecting others to decide when they get promoted. But you have the option to get out and take your own ride — the promotion is something you have to actively seek.

### What It Means to Take Control
Taking control doesn’t mean waiting for your manager to notice your hard work or hoping for recognition. Promotions are rarely handed over willingly; they must be taken. The language we use — "I got a promotion" or "I was given a promotion" — implies a passive process benefiting employers. In reality, you must make your intentions clear and proactively engage in the promotion conversation.

### The First Rule: Make Your Intentions Crystal Clear
During your next one-on-one with your manager, explicitly state your desire to get promoted and ask for feedback on what it takes to get there. Three outcomes are possible:

1. Your manager supports you fully.
2. Your manager provides concerns and feedback but is willing to work with you.
3. Your manager resists or postpones the conversation.

If you encounter resistance, you may need to consider repairing the relationship or finding a new manager who supports your growth. Managers are busy and often wait for you to show initiative.

### Overcoming Discomfort: How to Broach the Topic
If directly asking for a promotion feels uncomfortable, frame the discussion around career growth to ease into the conversation. Come prepared with documented criteria and progress metrics to guide the discussion. Remember, you don’t get what you don’t ask for.

### The Bigger Game: Showing Readiness for Broader Scope
Consider the story of Ben, a strong coder stuck at senior engineer for six years. He focused on excelling within his current scope, but promotion required demonstrating impact at a broader organizational level — leadership in system design, cross-functional projects, and business impact. Promotions depend on showing you can handle the next level’s challenges, not just execution at your current level.

### Avoid Waiting for the Perfect Moment
Waiting for the right project, timing, or readiness risks missing your opportunity. Like surge pricing in rideshare, the cost of waiting increases over time while competition and requirements don’t diminish. Promotion-driven development advice to "just be a better engineer" ignores how chasing promotions and skill improvement can happen together.

### Real-Life Consequences of Waiting
A senior engineer delayed his promotion packet for years waiting on project metrics, only to realize later he missed out on over a million dollars in compensation. Taking action sooner allowed him to secure a tough promotion quickly. Being proactive is not just about career satisfaction — it’s a financial imperative.

### Final Advice: Start Your Promotion Journey Now
Book your "ride" now: be direct, make your intentions known, and pursue your promotion even if it feels uncomfortable. The window of opportunity shrinks as you wait, so don’t delay. If you want to get to senior engineer or beyond, supplement this advice by checking out resources that improve your promotion situational awareness and readiness.

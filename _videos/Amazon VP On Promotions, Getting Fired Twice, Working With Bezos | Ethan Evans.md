### Ethan Evans: From Fired Twice to Amazon VP

Ethan Evans' career journey is one of transformation, persistence, and learning critical lessons about leadership and career management. Early in his career, Ethan was fired twice, largely because of his abrasive and confrontational style. After reflecting on the repeating pattern, he recognized that the common element was himself and decided to develop his soft skills and improve how he interacted with others.

### Early Career and Learning Soft Skills

Initially driven by enthusiasm and technical skill, Ethan rose in startups but struggled with interpersonal conflicts. He recalls being called a "loose cannon" because he often confronted colleagues aggressively. Over time, after careful reflection and feedback—especially when struggling to find new jobs—he realized that the gap was in his ability to work well with others. He embraced the psychology of work, motivation, and building persuasive relationships, shifting from making statements to asking insightful questions.

### Choosing Startups and Riding the Growth Escalator

Ethan's career started with a series of startups centered on high-speed networking and internet services. The decision to join startups was influenced by friends and the lure of stock options, a then-novel compensation method. Despite setbacks and redundancies during the dot-com bust, these experiences positioned him well for later opportunities.

Ethan advises always preferring high-growth companies as one's career "escalator," noting that while he climbed the ladder, the company was also growing exponentially, magnifying his career path.

### Transition to Amazon and Promotion Strategies

Ethan joined Amazon through a combination of opportunity and prior market knowledge, having studied Amazon as a competitor while working on Barnes & Noble's online strategy. Amazon was attractive due to its stability amidst a turbulent startup environment.

His promotions at Amazon were influenced by taking high-risk decisions — for instance, pushing forward projects against leadership advice but achieving success, such as a crucial partnership with Teo. He also learned the importance of politely but firmly advocating for his career goals, including subtle negotiation tactics rather than direct demands.

### The "Magic Loop" Partnership With Managers

One of Ethan's core strategies for advancement was developing the "magic loop" partnership with his managers. This involved deeply understanding what his leaders needed him to do, committing to delivering those results, and requiring managers to ensure he was rewarded appropriately. This alignment of incentives was key to his eventual promotion to VP after several years.

### Managing Promise and Process: The Missed Promotion Example

Ethan shares a candid story about a star engineer on his team who was promised a promotion that fell through due to Ethan's ignorance of Amazon's formal promotion cycle and processes. This serves as a cautionary tale about understanding company mechanisms, being proactive about deadlines, and communicating clearly in managing one's career development.

### Leadership at Amazon: Comparing Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy

Having had about 50 meetings each with Jeff Bezos and Andy Jassy, Ethan contrasts their leadership styles:

- Jeff Bezos, as founder, was willing to take bold gambles and conveyed emotional support and enthusiasm.
- Andy Jassy exemplifies traditional business leadership, focusing on partnership and accountability, sometimes with more scrutiny and less emotional backing.

This difference affected Ethan's motivation and working style.

### Running Large Teams and Integrating Twitch

As a VP, Ethan led the Amazon App Store with over 800 engineers and later took on a challenging role facilitating Twitch's integration post-acquisition. He relinquished direct authority and worked as an advisor to Twitch's CEO, focusing on influencing without formal control.

Key challenges included bridging generational and cultural differences, driving financial discipline in a venture-funded mindset that was initially resistant to profitability goals, and helping leadership make tough decisions about scaling the team.

### Reflections on Amazon's Performance Management Systems

Ethan discusses Amazon's controversial use of stack ranking and forced attrition quotas ("unregretted attrition"), which push managers to fire or pressure to quit a set percentage of employees annually (typically around 7%). Removing this quota led to fewer difficult conversations, so Amazon reinstated it.

He critiques PIPs (Performance Improvement Plans) as mostly ineffective and psychologically biased. Once an employee is on a PIP, a manager's cognitive bias often ensures termination. Coaching attempts rarely lead to rescue, and the system pressures managers to replace someone on a PIP to meet quotas.

He also reveals uncomfortable truths about manager influence: a manager can often "paint" an employee's performance story in an unfair light, impacting their career drastically. HR tends not to intervene effectively, so employees must be cautious in difficult relationships.

### Navigating Career Development and Advice

Ethan emphasizes the importance of building soft skills, maintaining relationships, and building a reputation, especially in high-growth organizations. He encourages proactive career management and understanding promotion processes.

He closes by highlighting his current focus: teaching classes on how to overcome promotion hurdles with straightforward, honest advice.

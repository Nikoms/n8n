## My thoughts

- Keep a simple, durable brag document to record your key accomplishments immediately after they happen.  
- Regularly practice interviewing to build active listening, communication, and calibration skills.  
- Learn to say no strategically, only accepting tasks that offer significant impact or value to you or others.

## TLDR;
- Leverage is doing more with less effort, applicable to career growth.
- Three high leverage career skills: document accomplishments effectively, improve interviewing skills, and learn to say no wisely.
- Use a brag document to record impactful achievements for future use in reviews, resumes, and interviews.
- Interviewing sharpens active listening, communication, and calibration skills, and should be practiced regularly but prepared for.
- Saying no protects your limited attention; say yes only when the benefit outweighs the effort or impact is high.
- Avoid common pitfalls like inconsistent documentation, neglecting interview prep, and saying yes too often without impact.

### Understanding Leverage in Your Career
Leverage means getting more output or value for less input or effort. As programmers, we understand this principle well—we make computers work for us, often while we sleep. Applying this to your career means focusing on doing fewer things but with greater impact. Steve Quinn, a Principal Software Engineer at Amazon, shares three high leverage skills that can boost your career instantly.

> "Leverage more and more output and value for less and less input and effort."

### High Leverage Skill #1: Document Your Accomplishments with a Brag Document
Many professionals struggle to recall their impactful work when it matters most, such as during end-of-year reviews or preparing resumes. Steve introduces the concept of a 'brag document' — a simple, durable text document where you record your key accomplishments as they happen.

**How to use it:**
- Create a new document for each year, accessible anywhere.
- When you do something impactful, write a brief paragraph detailing what you did, when, and with whom.

Steve's example entry demonstrates simplicity:

> "In April I led and organized a successful patent drive ... I personally filed X patents ..."

This practice ensures your achievements don't get lost and serves as a ready-made Greatest Hits mixtape for your career. Unlike cumbersome work journals or tracking tools, a brag document has low overhead and is created on demand, making it sustainable.

**Avoid:** Documenting every minor task or daily activity, which is not impactful and wastes time.

### High Leverage Skill #2: Master Interviewing and Maintain Your Skills
Interviewing is often seen as a chore but is actually a high leverage activity that builds critical skills such as active listening, communication, and calibration.

> "Active listening is the act of being present, processing what is said, and responding."

Conducting interviews teaches you to:
- Detect if answers truly address the question.
- Adjust questions for clarity and depth.
- Provide fair and accurate feedback.

This skill translates to better communication in meetings, performance reviews, and collaboration. Steve warns, however, that interviewing itself is not a substitute for proper interview preparation—practice helps but doesn't replace preparation.

**Frequency:** Regular practice (e.g., monthly or biweekly) is best. Overdoing it turns it into a tax instead of leverage.

**Avoid:** Treating interviews superficially or overestimating the improvement from interviewing alone.

### High Leverage Skill #3: Learn to Say No Strategically
Your undivided attention is your most precious resource. Saying no more often protects your time and energy from undifferentiated, low-impact work.

**When to say yes:**
1. When the benefit far exceeds the effort (e.g., a rare opportunity).
2. To do a big favor for someone who may help you in the future.
3. When you have bandwidth and the request involves low effort.

> "Say no 10 times more than you say yes."

Avoid only saying yes when there's a personal gain—that comes off as selfish and reduces trust and future opportunities.

Integrating the 'say no' skill with your brag document and interview skills creates a powerful, high-leverage career strategy.

### Final Thoughts and Next Steps
Starting a brag document takes about a minute, and maintaining it yearly takes about 10 minutes. Interviewing about 2.5 hours monthly helps maintain critical skills. Using impact as your primary criterion for saying yes or no reduces overload.

Steve encourages watching his follow-up video on career killers and invites viewers to join his journey by subscribing and asking questions.

> "You are now free to accelerate your career probably way past mine."

This comprehensive approach to leverage, interviewing, documentation, and priority management provides a clear roadmap for software engineers seeking to engineer their career growth.

## My thoughts

CCTO is a four-step thinking system to use every move in chess:  
- Checks: Look for any possible checks you can make.  
- Captures: Consider capturing opponent’s pieces, even if it’s not immediately beneficial.  
- Threats: Identify any threats you can pose, like attacking higher-value or unprotected pieces.  
- Optimization: Improve your position by developing pieces or advancing key pawns (E, D, C pawns).  

Using CCTO every move helps prevent blunders and guides strategic play during the middlegame.

## TLDR;
- Introduces a two-part middlegame chess strategy applicable after any opening.
- Part one: "Sit on your hands" – pause and analyze why the opponent made their move to avoid blunders.
- Part two: CCTO thinking system – check every move for Checks, Captures, Threats, and Optimization.
- Always perform CCTO on every move to prevent mistakes and find tactical opportunities.
- Optimization involves developing pieces and controlling central pawns (E, D, C).
- Demonstrates the method through a game against a 2300-rated opponent, showing how the framework avoids blunders and leads to winning.
- Emphasizes prioritizing blunder prevention and thoughtful positional improvement over risky play.
- The approach helped the speaker achieve a chess.com rating over 2200.
- Final stages highlight simple endgame technique with connected passed pawns to secure a win.

### Revolutionary Middlegame Strategy to Elevate Your Chess
This video introduces a transformative middlegame strategy designed to work with any opening — whether you play White or Black. The speaker emphasizes that this approach is not about memorizing openings but about a robust way to think after the opening phase that almost no one discusses.

### Part One: Blunder Prevention with "Sit on Your Hands"
The cornerstone of the strategy is blunder prevention. The speaker teaches aspiring players to resist the urge to move immediately after the opponent's move. Instead, you should "sit on your hands" and ask yourself: Why did my opponent make this move? What threats or plans are they aiming for? This step guards against tunnel vision and impulsive blunders that often undermine promising positions.

> "Blunder prevention will always be our number one priority."

### Part Two: The CCTO Thinking System
Each of your moves must be analyzed systematically using the CCTO framework:
- **Checks:** Can I make a move that checks the opponent's king?
- **Captures:** Are there any good captures to make?
- **Threats:** Do I have any threats (attacking a higher value piece or a vulnerable target)?
- **Optimization:** If none of the above apply, improve your position by developing pieces and controlling pawns, especially your central pawns (E, D, C). Optimize without overthinking; improving your position is key.

> "You need to force yourself every single move. Yes, every move. If you skip this for one move, you will be in trouble."

### Demonstration Against a 2300-Rated Opponent
The speaker demonstrates this two-part strategy through a complete game against a strong player rated 2300. Throughout, he applies "sit on your hands" and methodically uses the CCTO framework to avoid blunders and find strategic improvements.

Key points from the demonstration include:
- Identifying threats such as potential forks or attacks before acting.
- Evaluating captures by considering the consequences rather than impulsively grabbing material.
- Using "optimization" moves to develop pieces, control open files, and support pawns.
- Avoiding queen trades prematurely as material advantage is climbed incrementally.
- Recognizing when a queen can be trapped through combined piece pressure.
- Calculating exchanges that simplify into winning endgames.

> "Literally, just forcing yourself to do this every single move... you will mess up every single move if you don’t."

### Final Endgame Technique
In the concluding phase, the speaker highlights a favorite finishing method: using connected passed pawns and king activity to force promotion and win efficiently. He explains that if an opponent tries to capture one passed pawn, the other advances too quickly to be stopped.

> "If you ever have a position like this, just know that they cannot capture."

### Conclusion
By combining blunder prevention with a disciplined, repetitive thinking structure, players can unlock significant improvement without memorizing complex theory. This straightforward teaching, demonstrated in a real game, serves as a practical tool for all aspiring chess players to elevate their middlegame prowess and avoid costly mistakes.

The speaker encourages viewers to apply this strategy in their own games for immediate and impactful results.

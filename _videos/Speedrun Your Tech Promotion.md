## My thoughts

The video explains that promotion is not simply a reward for good work but requires demonstrating competence at the next level. High performance in your current role won’t guarantee advancement unless you can show you’re already handling the broader scope expected at the higher level. Understanding the promotion process and gathering concrete evidence of next-level impact are essential steps to getting promoted.

## TLDR;
- Promotions are not meritocracy but a process that can be optimized.
- Understand the promotion criteria and process within your company.
- High performance at the current level is not enough; demonstrate competence at the next level.
- Gather concrete evidence to document your capability at the next level.
- Write or help write specific, factual feedback highlighting your contributions and impact.
- Actively manage your career growth and promotion efforts.
- Use structured approaches to promotion to navigate difficult periods successfully.

### Understanding Promotions Aren't a Meritocracy but a Process
In the quest for career advancement, particularly in tech, it's a common misconception to view promotions purely as rewards for good work. My own journey, including five failed attempts over four years before finally becoming Principal Engineer, taught me otherwise. Promotions operate as a process, not a pure meritocracy. Knowing this process and its nuances is critical. Companies may revise their promotion paths, and staying informed—by consulting managers, peers, or HR—is essential to prevent setbacks, such as missed responsibilities or deadlines. As I like to say, "You can't beat a game if you don't know what the win conditions are."

### High Performance Alone Doesn’t Guarantee Promotion
I once mentored Lance, a stellar performer who nonetheless struggled to get promoted. Despite high-quality work, positive peer relations, and a satisfied manager, Lance's promotion feedback was lukewarm. Why? Tech promotions often follow the "anti-Peter Principle," requiring demonstration of ability at the next level, not just competence at the current one. "Performance at level—even high performance—is not enough to get promoted to the next level." The insight Lance took away was to take on broader scope, which led to his promotion three months later.

### The Power of Concrete Evidence in Promotion Cases
Consider this comparison: if choosing between two surgeons, one with loyal but vague praise and another with a 95% success rate supported by data, the choice is clear. Promotions work similarly—concrete, measurable evidence of performance at the next level outweighs qualitative endorsements. Many promotion packets fail by relying on generic praise such as "Steve is a great engineer." Instead, evidence-based statements like, "Steve designed and delivered a critical component improving response time by 10x," make a compelling case. To achieve this, proactively shape your work to generate such concrete feedback and assist colleagues in articulating these contributions when promotion time comes.

### Taking Control of Your Career Growth
Ownership of your professional advancement is critical. Beyond excelling at your tasks, understand the promotion criteria, anticipate changes, and actively manage your feedback and evidence. I advise writing the promotion feedback you want to receive and aligning your work to create those narrative points. This structured approach can reduce ambiguity and help you target your efforts effectively.

### Closing Thoughts
Navigating promotions, especially at senior levels in tech, is a complex journey requiring more than just hard work. Understanding the process, demonstrating readiness for more responsibility, and documenting your impact concretely pave the way for success. As I often say, "Promotions are about demonstrating the ability to handle a broader scope, not just past performance."

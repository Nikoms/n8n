## My thoughts

Not specified (yet)

## TLDR;
- Working hard alone does not guarantee career advancement; it is crucial to work on problems others care about.
- Career growth parallels 'product market fit' in startups: your skills (product) must solve costly, painful problems (market) that the company values.
- Asking the right questions to your manager about their pains reveals opportunities to add value.
- Identify your unique skills by recognizing the problems you naturally solve, activities that energize you, and compliments you undervalue.
- The 'value loop' framework: solve a specific problem for one person, generalize the solution into reusable tools or processes, and announce your achievements to build recognition and opportunities.
- Being essential at work comes from connecting your unique abilities to real business pain points, not just technical skill or effort.

### Understanding Why Hard Work May Go Unnoticed
Steve Quinn explains why putting in a lot of effort does not always translate into promotions, recognition, or exciting projects. Despite being reliable, responsive, and hitting deadlines, many professionals stay stuck because they are targeting the wrong problems—the wrong "market". "Nobody cares how hard you work if you're hitting the wrong target. They only care about the value you create." This misalignment is like repeatedly throwing darts at the same wrong spot. Success in a career is less about sheer effort and more about creating value that others recognize as important.

### The Concept of Product Market Fit Applied to Careers
Borrowing from startup terminology, Steve compares one's career to finding "product market fit." Just as startups fail without a market valuing their product, skilled workers can flounder if their work doesn't solve significant, painful problems for their company. He recounts meeting a talented YouTuber with thousands of videos but few viewers because the content never found its market. Likewise, engineers who succeed are those who find the "right market"—the costly, painful issues that their company desperately needs solved.

### Discovering Your Market Through Effective Communication
Steve advises that the key to finding your target is market research focused on your "customer"—your manager. However, typical questions about performance yield unreliable praise. Instead, he suggests asking about frustrations, biggest team slowdowns, or pain points. These reveal the most pressing problems to solve. A case study from Amazon illustrates this: rather than training engineers for a supposed skills gap, Steve discovered the pain was a broken deployment process costing weeks of productivity. Framing technical problems as business losses helped secure leadership buy-in and resources.

### Identifying Your Unique Skill as Your Product
Every professional has a unique skill set forming their "product." Steve's framework for discovering this involves:
- Recognizing what problems you are naturally drawn to.
- Noticing activities that energize you while tiring others.
- Paying attention to compliments you dismiss as "too easy."
These clues highlight your authentic skill, which is crucial for achieving product market fit.

### Executing with the Value Loop: From Helpful to Essential
Steve shares how refactoring code he loved went unnoticed, but a quick Python script automating a tedious task made him a hero. The difference was solving a problem others cared about. His "value loop" framework:
1. Solve a problem for one person and provide a clear win.
2. Generalize the solution into reusable tools, templates, or processes.
3. Announce and share the solution widely to build reputation.
This cycle turns isolated helpful acts into repeatable systems that make you indispensable and visible.

### Final Insights
Success comes from connecting what you uniquely offer to the expensive, painful problems your organization faces. Steve urges professionals to stop perfecting their skills in isolation and start engaging deeply with their market. Asking about pain rather than performance, building skills to solve real issues, and turning solutions into shared systems will make all the hard work truly count.

"The hardest workers don't always win. The people with the best skills don't always get promoted. The ones who succeed are the ones who find product market fit."

For those seeking to further improve, Steve also offers a video on better verbal communication, distilled into four simple steps based on his extensive learning.

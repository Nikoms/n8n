### How to Answer Interview Questions at Amazon: Behavioral Insights and Leadership Principles

This guide provides deep insights on how to navigate behavioral interview questions at Amazon, focusing on their leadership principles and showcasing how to position yourself as the best candidate.

### Customer Obsession: Going Beyond the Surface

Customer Obsession is more than just solving urgent problems or pushing shady deals. It means going above and beyond for customers for the right reasons. For example, simply fixing a bug under time pressure doesn’t demonstrate true customer obsession. Instead, it is about consistently prioritizing customer benefits in ethical and impactful ways.

> “Customer obsession is when you literally go above and beyond for the customers for the right reasons.”

### Deliver Results: Showcasing Successful Outcomes

When asked about projects where you got stuck 75% through, emphasize successful completion and highlight your strengths in overcoming challenges relevant to your role. Avoid focusing on partial successes or failures unless you can convincingly sell those as learning experiences.

> “Most of the time, you should talk about a successful project which you successfully completed ultimately.”

### Handling Failure: Be Honest, But Strategic

Discuss failures that do not endanger your candidacy, highlighting the learnings gained. Half of your answer should explain what you learned. Avoid failure stories that could raise red flags, like being fired for major mistakes. Failure questions test your preparation and your ability to sell yourself even on imperfect outcomes.

> “Learning should be half of your answer and don’t shoot yourself in the foot.”

### Dealing with Ambiguity: Use Experience and Seek Clarity

Define what ambiguity means in your role and illustrate how you have dealt with it, whether through leveraging past experience, consulting others for advice, or educating yourself to fill knowledge gaps. This reflects the Leadership Principle "Are Right, A Lot."

> “Best answers are when you use previous experience, ask for additional advice, or recognize the need for more info to make the right call.”

### Convincing Others: Building Trust is Key

Success in persuading others is built on earning and maintaining trust. Avoid blaming others or making excuses about luck. Demonstrate how you nurtured relationships to gain stakeholder buy-in.

> “Focus on gaining their trust; trust is the central and main thing.”

### Disagreement with Your Boss: Disagree and Commit

When describing disagreements, present data-driven points and communicate respectfully. Avoid sounding argumentative. This displays the value of having backbone while maintaining commitment.

> “Found data to make your point, communicated efficiently, and aimed to establish trust.”

### Why Amazon: Show What’s in it for You

Instead of just praising Amazon, focus on personal motivations and what you bring to or gain from working at Amazon. This commercial awareness and backbone help differentiate you from other candidates.

> “Think about what’s in for you and sell yourself on that during the interview.”

### Setting Vision When None Exists: Think Big

Provide examples of proactive vision-setting, such as integrating AI features to improve training engagement. Successful visions focus on delivering tangible results aligned with company goals.

> “My goal was to increase engagement by rewarding candidates for writing stories using generative AI.”

### Ownership: Taking Initiative Beyond Your Role

Ownership means taking responsibility beyond your usual tasks, acting in the company's best interests. Memorable examples, even exaggerated, such as saving someone, illustrate going the extra mile.

> “Highlight your ownership, not just getting things done but for the sake of being memorable.”

### Speed: Be Biased for Action with Reversible Decisions

Illustrate how you made timely decisions where possible, especially when decisions are reversible. This principle underscores the importance of speed over perfection in fast-moving environments.

> “The decision timeline was reversible, so speed was core in that scenario.”

### Inventions: Make Them Memorable

Sharing innovations or inventions that are unique and impactful, like AI systems to detect potholes, helps you stand out and score points.

> “Can you make your invention memorable so it sticks after the interview?”

### Learning: Display Curiosity and Forward Thinking

Describe how you use multiple sources to learn, experiment, and avoid familiar, backward-looking approaches. This demonstrates curiosity and adaptability.

> “Use multiple sources, show forward thinking and experimentation.”

### Weaknesses: Address the Elephant in the Room

Choose real, job-relevant weaknesses and frame them positively. Selling yourself even in discussing weaknesses can increase your chances of success.

> “Address the elephant in the room and use it to sell yourself.”

This comprehensive advice equips candidates to meet Amazon’s rigorous interview standards, emphasizing leadership principles and strategic communication to stand out successfully.

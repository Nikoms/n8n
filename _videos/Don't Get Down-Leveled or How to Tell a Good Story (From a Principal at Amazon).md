## My thoughts

When interviewing, use stories that incorporate key terms from the job offer to clearly anchor your role and responsibilities. The video explains that aligning your story with the job description helps the interviewer judge your level accurately by showing you handle challenges relevant to that position. Focus on showing how you overcame significant obstacles to achieve a positive, though not perfect, outcome. Avoid exaggerations or including villains, as authenticity and clarity build credibility.

## TLDR;
- Companies often use down leveling to hedge against risk when there is ambiguity about candidate level.
- Levels vary across companies and are relative; use tools like Levels.fyi and Glassdoor for research.
- Down leveling usually happens due to weak behavioral interview performance despite technical skills or vice versa.
- Effective storytelling in interviews is key—focus on showing how you meet the role's challenges using a clear story shape.
- Avoid lying or exaggerating stories as interviewers will ask detailed follow-ups.
- Use the "U-shaped" story model: anchor your role/status, present significant challenges, and show positive but realistic outcomes.
- STAR method is useful for checking stories but not for creating them.
- Never portray villains prominently; keep professionalism and end stories with a balanced success.
- Being honest and aligning your stories with the expected level helps avoid unnecessary down leveling.
- The goal is to come in at the right level to avoid long-term issues from mismatched expectations.

### Understanding Down Leveling and Why it Happens

In the real world, companies do not have standardized leveling systems, which creates challenges for candidates during hiring. Hiring managers often face a dilemma: hiring at too high a level can lead to long-term problems such as performance issues or even termination, wasting time and resources that teams cannot afford. To mitigate this risk, many companies engage in down leveling—a practice of offering candidates roles below the level they might expect. While frustrating, this is a protective measure against ambiguity in assessing levels.

> "Hiring somebody at too high of a level has disastrous long-term consequences. It takes a long time to fix these problems and usually ends poorly."

Two situations arise when you feel down leveled: one, the company made a correct assessment of your level; two, they made a mistake and you really operate at a higher level than recognized.

### Levels Are Relative Across Companies

Levels vary widely by company and context. For example, a CTO of a small startup might be considered a senior developer at a larger company. It helps to use resources like [Levels.fyi](https://levels.fyi) or Glassdoor to research typical expectations and levels in companies you're applying to. However, be cautious about anonymous forums like Blind as they can contain unreliable claims.

> "The key here is to be honest with yourself after doing your research. Your goal should be to write-level yourself at the new company."

### Why Down Leveling Happens: Behavioral vs. Technical Skills

Interviews generally combine technical (functional) and behavioral questions. Neither alone guarantees an offer; strengths in both areas are required. Down leveling typically occurs in two cases:

1. Mediocre coding performance but strong behavioral interview results.
2. Strong coding and design skills but weak behavioral communication or storytelling.

In these cases, improving behavioral interview skills is often the best way to avoid unwanted down leveling.

### The Power of Storytelling in Interviews

Humans are narrative-driven, and interviewers seek stories that clearly demonstrate your capabilities relevant to their needs. Simply stating how good you are is less effective than showing it through compelling stories.

> "Your job is to convey to the interviewer that you have what it takes to fill the need they have."

The traditional STAR (Situation, Task, Action, Results) method is commonly taught but overly focuses on what happened rather than portraying your character and growth through challenges.

### The 'U-Shaped' Story Model

Inspired by Kurt Vonnegut's story shapes, the recommended narrative structure starts by anchoring your story on your role and responsibilities. You then introduce multiple, layered challenges that dip into significant difficulty and end with a positive, balanced resolution.

- The starting and ending points indicate your operating level.
- The depth of the "U" symbolizes the scale of problems you can handle.

This approach helps interviewers easily judge if you operate at the level you claim.

> "Many layers of challenge make your success all the more satisfying and clear to the interviewer."

### Crafting Authentic, Credible Stories

Avoid fabricating details or stories. Interviewers will ask detailed follow-ups and inconsistencies can cost you the offer. Do not tell tales about others' experiences or make villains the focus; keep your stories professional and focused on your role. Also, endings should reflect realistic success, not perfect resolutions.

> "It's better to spend your energy on being a badass rather than concocting a story about how much of a badass you are."

### Final Advice for Navigating Interview Levels

- Accept that levels are relative across companies.
- Use research tools to understand level expectations.
- Aim to enter at the right level to avoid having to fight for a promotion later.
- Focus on strong behavioral storytelling to complement your technical skills.
- Use the 'U-shaped' story model to organize your experiences effectively.
- Be honest, sincere, and professional in your stories.

### Example Story using the U-Shape Model

Meta, a principal engineer with 15 years at Amazon and a technical interviewer, shares a story where his team inherits buggy, risky software dependent on a disallowed library. After assessing the scale of the problem and engaging multiple client teams through a deprecation campaign, they decommission the service in time to meet a major launch. This story anchors Meta's leadership role, presents real challenges, and concludes with a positive architectural outcome despite interpersonal strains.

> "On balance, it came to a positive outcome. Pretty happy with the way that the architecture looks afterwards."

This kind of story effectively conveys the right level of responsibility, complexity, and impact expected for senior roles.

Mastering your narrative and understanding company leveling practices empowers you to better position yourself and succeed in technical interviews.

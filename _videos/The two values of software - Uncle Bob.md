## My thoughts

The video explains that software has two fundamental values: what it does (the functionality) and how it is structured. A system that works but isn’t well-structured will be hard to evolve, while a system that may not work today but has a flexible structure is easier to adapt and fix over time. Since software by nature must change, its value lies more in its flexibility and maintainability than just in meeting current requirements. The “soft” in software highlights this need for flexibility and ongoing evolution.

## TLDR;
- Software has two key values: what it does (functionality) and its structure.
- Programmers often focus only on functionality and meeting current requirements.
- The structure, or flexibility to change, is arguably more valuable.
- Software must be changeable because requirements evolve; otherwise, it becomes worthless.
- Low cost of modification is crucial for ongoing adaptability.
- Maximizing functionality today at the expense of flexibility can lead to project failure.
- Good software balances working functionality with a well-designed, adaptable structure.

### The Two Essential Values of Software
Software holds two fundamental values: the value of what it does—its functionality—and the value of its structure. Most programmers tend to focus on the first value, believing that satisfying the current set of requirements is enough. However, this perspective misses a crucial point. While meeting user demands is important, it only addresses half of what makes software valuable.

### Why Structure Matters More
The structure of software is arguably the more important value because software by nature must be flexible. It is a "flexible product." Requirements change over time, and if software cannot be modified easily, its usefulness degrades rapidly. The speaker emphasizes, "If it is not changeable, the software has no value." Even software that works perfectly today becomes worthless tomorrow if it cannot adapt to new demands.

### Flexibility is Key to Continued Success
The key is not just that software works today, but that it can be changed efficiently and cost-effectively. Software that is changeable, even if it doesn't work perfectly now, has more potential because it can be improved. On the contrary, maximizing functionality at the expense of maintainability and adaptability will increase modification costs and may lead to the project's failure as changes become inhibited.

### Balancing Functionality and Structure
The talk stresses the need to always keep both values in mind: software must not only work but also be "right"—meaning well-structured and thoughtfully designed. While perfection is unnecessary, the structure must be good enough to enable easy modification, ensuring the software maintains its value over time.

In summary, the speaker teaches that software development should always strive to maximize the structural value—the ease of modification and adaptability—alongside meeting present functional requirements. This balance is crucial for the long-term success and relevance of any software product.

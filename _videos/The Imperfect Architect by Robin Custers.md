## My thoughts

Not specified (yet)

## TLDR;
- The talk is about the role and challenges of being an IT architect.
- An architect is both a leader and a craftsman, requiring decision-making and leadership skills.
- Humans often rely on fast intuitive thinking (System 1), which can lead to poor decisions; architects should engage in slower, analytical thinking (System 2) to improve decisions.
- The Pareto Principle applies: focus on the 20% effort that resolves 80% of problems.
- Use the tracer bullet approach to explore problems early and reduce risk by validating decisions from the start.
- Avoid innovation addiction and fashion-driven development; prioritize solutions that deliver the best return on investment.
- Leadership requires adapting style to the team members' experience and motivation (situational leadership).
- Dealing with organizational politics is crucial; building trust turns adversaries into allies.
- Political capital is like a bank account of trust and influence that requires careful management.
- The perfect architect does not exist; common sense is the most valuable tool.





## Content

### Introduction and Personal Background
Robin Kustus opens his talk by relating a personal story about trying to explain his job as an IT architect to his children and their teacher, highlighting the common misconception and lack of understanding about what architects do. He jokes about the perception that architects just attend meetings and thanks his colleagues for their support and book recommendations on how to improve as an architect.

### Early Career and Initial Challenges
He reflects on his early experience starting as a junior architect in 2012 where he was unprepared for the responsibilities and pitfalls of the role. He shares the insight that becoming a good architect involves messing up many times and learning from those experiences, though this is not something to openly admit to clients.

### The Meaning of Architect: Leader and Craftsman
Drawing from the ancient Greek origins of the word architect, he emphasizes the dual nature of the role—as both a leader (archie) and a craftsman (tecton). Both aspects are vital: leadership to guide teams and craftsmanship to make sound technical decisions.

### Decision Making and Cognitive Biases
Robin explains human decision-making biases with classic research examples, such as perceptions of job offers and monetary loss scenarios, showing how intuitive decisions (System 1) can be flawed. He advocates for engaging System 2 thinking, which is slower and analytical, to improve decision quality. He stresses the importance of exploring multiple options and conducting trade-off analyses.

### Practical Advice for Architects: Focus on Common Cases and De-risk Early
He discusses applying the Pareto Principle by focusing initially on the 20% of effort that solves 80% of the problem, avoiding overcomplicating edge cases early on. He introduces the "tracer bullet" approach, which involves exploring different problem parts early in development to reduce risks and validate decisions as the project progresses.

### Caution Against Innovation Addiction
Robin warns against the temptation to chase every new technology or methodology (innovation addiction) and stresses choosing solutions that provide the best return on investment within time and budget constraints. He illustrates this with a humorous example of automating tasks that do not economically justify the effort.

### Leadership and Situational Leadership Model
He shares leadership challenges with anecdotes, including a junior developer accidently dropping a production database and the frustrations of pushing for foundational work under tight deadlines. Robin introduces the Situational Leadership model, explaining how leaders must adjust their directive and supportive behaviors based on the experience and motivation of their team members. For example, juniors require clear instructions, while experienced motivated staff need autonomy.

### Navigating Politics and Building Organizational Trust
Robin tells a story of a difficult political encounter with an adversarial architect, illustrating how personal history and lack of trust can hinder collaboration. He presents the Agreement Trust Matrix to categorize people in an organization into allies, opponents, bad fellows, and adversaries, emphasizing the need to build trust to convert adversaries into valuable challengers or supporters.

### Political Capital in Organizations
He explains political capital as the accumulated goodwill and influence crucial for successful decision-making in organizations. Managing this "bank account" carefully—building it through relationships and avoiding incidents that deplete it—is essential for architects to effectively lead and influence.

### Conclusion and Key Takeaways
Robin concludes by revisiting the idea that architects learn through mistakes but offers practical guidance to reduce mishaps:

- Make system two analytical decision-making a habit by evaluating options and trade-offs.
- Avoid adopting trendy methods without clear ROI.
- Lead with situational awareness and adapt to team needs.
- Build and maintain trust to gain influence.
- Use common sense as your most powerful tool.

He humorously notes that the perfect architect is like the Loch Ness monster—rumored but never seen. He invites the audience to follow his work on LinkedIn for more in-depth articles.

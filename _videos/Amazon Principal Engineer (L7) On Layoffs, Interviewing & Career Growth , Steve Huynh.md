## My thoughts

The video highlights how crucial the behavioral part of the interview is, as interviewers want to understand if they’d like to work with you. Preparing and sharing relevant stories that align with the job description can prevent being down-leveled, especially when aiming for senior or principal roles. It also stresses the importance of directly asking your manager about their expectations and checking where you stand, which helps clarify goals and avoid surprises.

## TLDR;
- Interviewing at big tech involves not just coding and system design skills but also strong behavioral fit and cultural alignment.
- Networking and preparedness are crucial opportunities for entry into big tech, especially without a traditional CS degree.
- Behavioral interviews have significant weight; poor behavioral answers can lead to rejections even if technical skills are good.
- Success at Amazon requires independence at junior levels, ownership at mid-level, and the ability to deliver large scope cross-functional impact at principal level.
- Amazon has an intense performance culture with stack ranking and managing out low performers, typically around 5-6% annually.
- Good Amazon managers are principle-based and think long-term, while bad managers may be overly delivery-focused or lacking leadership qualities.
- Choosing one technical area and going deep is better than broad shallow skills for standing out in job hunting.
- AI tools amplify engineers but do not replace senior-level work; zero to one and scaling still need human expertise.
- Promotion to principal is hard because it requires demonstrating impact across multiple teams and balancing coding with leadership.
- Career advice includes proactive communication with managers, early feedback seeking, and making deliberate career decisions rather than inertia.
- Amazon culture emphasizes customer obsession and a strong writing and reading culture.
- The biggest career regret is not recognizing a bad situation early enough and deciding deliberately whether to stay or leave.
- Pleasing oneself rather than others is vital for career satisfaction and direction.

### Breaking into Big Tech Without a CS Degree
The guest, a former principal engineer at Amazon with a liberal arts background in English literature and creative writing, shares his journey of entering Amazon not through a traditional CS degree but through networking and leveraging prior programming experience from high school. He stresses the importance of marrying opportunity with preparedness, noting that opportunities often come unexpectedly, and being ready through skills and study is essential. He recounts how a colleague referral helped him get an interview, highlighting that referrals remain a powerful entry mechanism.
> "It takes two things: opportunity and study. You don't know when opportunity will show up, but when it does, you better be ready."

### Interviewing in Big Tech: More Than Just Coding
He explains the interviewing process at Amazon and big tech generally, emphasizing that coding and system design are necessary but not sufficient. Behavioral interviews play a critical role because they assess culture fit and whether the interviewers want to work with the candidate. Despite a prevailing industry focus on coding interview prep, he argues behavioral preparation deserves equal or greater emphasis.
> "If you can't code, they'll say no, but if your behavioral answers are poor, they'll also say no—even if your coding is great."
To improve in behavioral interviews, candidates should focus on packaging their experience effectively—articulating who they are, how they operate, and telling their professional story in a clear and empathetic way.

### The Competitive Landscape and How to Stand Out
The guest dispels myths around intense competition at the coding interview phase, stating real competition happens before that during selection and recruiting. He recommends being an outlier through genuine networking and deep expertise in a focused technical area rather than being broadly shallow.
> "Go deep rather than broad. Pick an area you like and understand it deeply—pop the hood on the technologies."

### Managing Career Growth and Promotions at Amazon
He candidly discusses the progression from junior to principal engineer levels at Amazon:
- **SD1 (Junior):** Focus on independence—being able to take tasks from start to finish without handholding.
- **SD2 (Mid-level):** Ownership of team codebases and operational responsibilities.
- **SD3 (Senior) to Principal:** Requires cross-team impact and leading large scope projects.

He highlights the challenges of the principal promotion, which requires simultaneously meeting multiple high-level criteria and often takes several years. The promotion process is complex and may involve conflicting expectations between coding contributions and leadership roles.

He advises starting promo preparations early, focusing on closing gaps and weaknesses rather than overemphasizing strengths.

### Amazon's Culture: Strengths and Challenges
Favorite cultural aspects include **customer obsession** and a rigorous **writing culture** where detailed documents precede discussions. This helps align teams effectively.
> "Nobody ever gave lip service to the customer experience—it was always the highest priority from interns to VPs."
Challenges include frugality taken to extremes, such as limited hardware resources and minimalist perks. The high-performance culture results in annual stack ranking where roughly 5-6% of employees may be managed out, prioritizing those who thrive in the intense environment.

### Managing Up and Dealing with Managers
Over 18 years, he worked under 17+ managers. Good managers were principle-driven, thought long-term, and balanced immediate delivery with future considerations. Bad managers were sometimes micromanagers or lacked leadership capabilities.

He stresses that direct communication with managers about expectations and proactive career development plans is crucial.

### Impact of AI on the Industry
He views AI as an amplifier tool rather than a replacement, especially for senior roles. AI can help junior engineers move from zero to one but is less capable at scaling systems to large production demands.

### Reflections and Career Advice
His biggest regret is inertia—failing to recognize and act on a bad team or situation sooner.
He encourages deliberate career decisions rather than defaulting to stay.
He also advises young professionals to prioritize pleasing themselves over others, avoiding chasing external validation.

### Final Words
The guest invites viewers to explore his YouTube channel "Life Engineered" and his newsletter for more insights on tech careers.

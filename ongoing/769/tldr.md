- Mocking is a controversial but valuable tool in test driven development (TDD).
- Common misuse: mocking third-party code, which is risky and usually a mistake.
- Unit tests measure code behavior: return values, state changes, or interactions.
- Good tests measure code in controlled, repeatable ways to aid design and change.
- Over-mocking tightly couples tests to implementation, making refactoring difficult.
- Good design hides complexity and minimizes communication between code parts.
- Abstraction layers should be created over third-party code rather than directly mocking it.
- Testing should focus on what matters, not on internal implementation details.
- Acceptance tests are better for verifying interactions with complex external systems.
- Mocking third-party libraries leads to fragile, complicated tests; simple facades improve testability.
- Keep code easy to read, test, and change by avoiding mocking the generic third-party libraries directly.

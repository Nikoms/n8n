- Acceptance tests are written from the perspective of an external user, focusing on what the system should do, not how.
- Fragility of acceptance tests often arises due to changes in system behavior, necessitating separation of concerns.
- The proposed solution is a four-layer architecture: Test Cases, DSL, Protocol Drivers, and System Under Test.
- Test Cases describe user behavior in domain language without implementation details.
- The DSL layer provides reusable methods to express test scenarios abstractly and precisely.
- Protocol Drivers translate domain-level instructions into real interactions with the system (e.g., UI or API calls).
- This separation allows test cases to remain stable despite system code changes.
- The approach supports various implementation styles including internal DSLs and external DSLs like Cucumber or SpecFlow.
- The method has been proven effective in complex environments and supports reuse and rapid test writing.
- A free guide and example code are available from the author to assist with acceptance testing implementation.

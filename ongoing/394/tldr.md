- The difference between architecture and design is a spectrum, not binary.
- Key criteria include structural involvement, strategic vs. tactical nature, level of effort, and significance of trade-offs.
- Architecture decisions involve system structure, strategic impact, high effort, and significant trade-offs.
- Design decisions mostly involve source code, are tactical, low effort, and have less significant trade-offs.
- Responsibility for decision-making depends on these criteria; architects should handle architectural decisions and developers handle design decisions.
- Example: Choosing microservices is architectural; choosing a design pattern is design; breaking a payment service is in the middle.
- Understanding this helps clarify decision impact, involvement, and responsibility.

The video outlines four key criteria to differentiate between architecture and design decisions:

- Whether the decision involves structural aspects of the system (such as component organization, deployment units, and communication) or just source code.
- Whether the decision is strategic (involving many people and taking weeks or months) or tactical (quick decisions by few people).
- The level of effort required, with higher effort decisions leaning more towards architecture.
- The significance of trade-offs, where more impactful pros and cons indicate architectural decisions and less significant ones indicate design decisions.

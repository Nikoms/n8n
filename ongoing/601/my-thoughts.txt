The video explains that the difference between architecture and design lies on a spectrum rather than a strict boundary. To determine where a decision falls, consider these criteria: whether the decision involves the structural aspects of the system or just source code; if it is strategic (involving many people and longer timelines) or tactical (quick, small group decisions); the level of effort required; and the significance of the trade-offs involved. These factors help clarify who should be responsible for the decision and its overall impact on the system.

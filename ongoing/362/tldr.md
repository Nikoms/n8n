- Test-driven development (TDD) is about writing tests first, making them fail, writing just enough code to pass, and then refactoring.
- TDD helps design better external interfaces and internal implementations through iterative feedback.
- Testability drives better software design with modularity, separation of concerns, and loose coupling.
- Learning TDD can be challenging because it exposes and improves design skills, which take a lifetime to master.
- Writing tests first is critical to gain the full benefits of TDD; writing tests after implementation loses key design feedback.
- Approval testing is useful for legacy code but is different from canonical TDD because assertions are defined after implementation.
- Teaching TDD helps developers become better at software design, resulting in more flexible, maintainable, and business-aligned software.
- Practical advice: write tests and assertions backward in comments to clarify design before coding.

# The Dead Simple Reason You're Not Getting Promoted (Ex-Amazon Principal Engineer)

## TLDR;

- Getting promoted in Tech is rarely about just technical skills, leadership, or communication alone.
- The key to promotions is taking control of your career and explicitly communicating your promotion intentions.
- Waiting passively for recognition or your manager to initiate promotion discussions often leads to delays and missed opportunities.
- Have a clear, direct conversation with your manager about your promotion goals.
- Promote yourself by demonstrating readiness for bigger scope and business impact, not just technical excellence at your current level.
- Use company promotion criteria actively, identify gaps, and work intentionally on them.
- Don’t postpone your promotion request waiting for the perfect moment; act even if situations aren’t ideal.
- If your manager isn’t supportive, consider finding a new manager or team.
- The idea is to 'take the wheel' of your promotion journey rather than wait passively in the passenger seat.

### Understanding What Really Drives Tech Promotions

In the tech industry, many believe that climbing the ladder is primarily about technical skills or leadership prowess. However, after working with nearly 500 tech professionals, it becomes clear that there's one fundamental trait that truly separates those who get promoted and those who don’t: taking active control of your career progression.

### The Promotion Ride Share Analogy

Imagine being a passenger in a rideshare car that keeps passing your destination. You keep hoping the driver will stop for you next, but they don't. This is how most people treat promotions—waiting passively for their turn, hoping someone recognizes their hard work. The truth is, you have the power to 'get out and get your own car' by taking charge rather than waiting.

### The Importance of Making Your Intentions Crystal Clear

Promotions aren’t about being buddy-buddy with your manager or waiting for them to notice your efforts. You must be explicit and direct with your manager about your desire for promotion. This means having a candid conversation in your next one-on-one, clearly stating your goals, and asking what it will take to get promoted.

There are three typical outcomes:

1. Your manager actively supports you.
2. Your manager provides feedback and is willing to work with you.
3. Your manager resists or postpones the conversation.

If it’s the last, you may need to consider repairing the relationship or finding a more supportive manager elsewhere.

### What to Do If You’re Uncomfortable Asking Directly

If a direct promotion conversation feels too confrontational, shift the discussion to career growth. Say something like, "In our next one-on-one, I’d like to discuss my career growth and performance expectations." Bring documentation comparing your current level to the next level’s criteria to facilitate a productive dialogue.

### Shifting Perspective: Play the Next Level Game

Take the story of Ben, a stellar engineer stuck at the senior level. He excelled at coding but hadn’t demonstrated capability at the broader business and architectural decisions required for the next level. Getting promoted means showing you can handle bigger scope, cross-functional leadership, and business impact—not just be exceptional at your current tasks.

### Leverage Your Company’s Level Guidelines

Most companies provide clear leveling criteria—use these to identify your gaps and discuss them openly with your manager. Avoid simply doing more of what you already excel at; focus on building skills and experiences to close those gaps.

### Don’t Postpone Your Promotion Request

Waiting for the perfect project, timing, or "readiness" can cost you dearly. Promotion requirements don’t get easier with time, and the competition doesn’t fade away. Like surge pricing in a rideshare, the longer you wait, the higher your cost in lost opportunities and compensation.

### Be Impatient With Your Career Progression

Promotion-driven development—focusing only on what’s needed to get promoted—gets criticized, but wanting promotion and aiming to improve as an engineer can coexist. Don’t let deflections or delays from your manager hold you back. Put yourself forward, even if conditions aren’t perfect.

### Conclusion: Take the Driver’s Seat

Ultimately, getting promoted is about self-advocacy, clarity, and boldness. Make your ambitions clear, start the conversation, work on leveling up your scope, and don’t wait on others to hand you what you deserve. Your career is your ride—take the wheel and drive it yourself.

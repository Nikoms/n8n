- Architecture and design exist on a spectrum, not a binary distinction.
- Criteria to differentiate include structural impact, strategic vs tactical nature, effort required, and significance of trade-offs.
- Architectural decisions involve system structure, are strategic, high effort, and have significant trade-offs.
- Design decisions focus on source code organization, are tactical, low effort, with less significant trade-offs.
- Responsibility for decisions depends on where they fall on this spectrumâ€”architects handle architectural ones, developers handle design ones, with collaboration.
- Example: Choosing microservices is architectural; using strategy design pattern is design; breaking payment service into smaller services falls in between.
- Understanding these differences helps clarify responsibility and impact of decisions.

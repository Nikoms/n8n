Good video explaining that the difference between architecture and design is not binary but a spectrum of decisions. The video offers clear criteria to help determine where a decision lies, such as whether it’s structural, strategic, involves high effort, or has significant trade-offs. This framework clarifies who should be responsible for each decision and highlights the impact architectural decisions have compared to design ones. It’s a useful guide for balancing collaboration and responsibility in software projects.

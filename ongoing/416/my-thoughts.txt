Good video that clearly explains the difference between architecture and design as a spectrum rather than a strict divide. It provides useful criteria—like structural impact, strategic versus tactical nature, effort involved, and significance of trade-offs—to help determine who should make a decision and how impactful it will be. The examples, from microservices to design patterns and service decomposition, effectively highlight how decisions vary along the spectrum. This makes it a practical guide for clarifying responsibilities and understanding decision impacts in software development.

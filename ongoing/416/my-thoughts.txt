Good video explaining that the difference between architecture and design is not binary but a spectrum of decisions. It breaks down clear criteria—structural impact, strategic vs. tactical nature, level of effort, and significance of trade-offs—to help identify where a decision falls. As the video highlights, understanding this helps clarify who should ultimately be responsible for making each decision and its overall impact on the system. "Everything in software architecture has trade-offs."

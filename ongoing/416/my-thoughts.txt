Good video that clearly explains the difference between architecture and design as a spectrum rather than a strict divide. It provides practical criteria—like structural impact, strategic versus tactical scope, effort involved, and trade-offs—to help determine who should be responsible for a decision and understand its impact. The examples, from microservices to design patterns, illustrate how this framework applies in real scenarios. This makes it a useful guide for both architects and developers to collaborate effectively.

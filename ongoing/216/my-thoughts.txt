To get promoted, you need to stop assuming your work will speak for itself and start being visible to the right people. That means actively positioning yourself as a future leader by taking on leadership roles and speaking up about your goals before you’re ready. Strategic self-advocacy is key: regularly update your manager on your progress and ask clearly for stretch assignments or opportunities to grow. Building a “brag document” can help make your accomplishments visible and ensure your impact is recognized.

### Hack 1: Use Your Feed to Feed Your Mind
The speaker rejects the common advice to delete social media, instead advocating for hacking your algorithm by teaching your preferences and unfollowing harmful accounts. He emphasizes integrating what you learn by saving information and sharing it with others. As he says, "Use it [social media] in a way that actually makes you better."

### Hack 2: Forget Work-Life Balance, Embrace Integration
Rather than separating work and life, the speaker works seven days a week and integrates his passions like mountain biking with business. He applies the Eisenhower matrix, focusing evenings on tasks that are important but not urgent, such as strategy and relationship-building. "If you love the work you do, you'll never work a day in your life," he quotes his father, highlighting his life approach.

### Hack 3: Schedule Family Time with Presence
The difference between simply having kids and being a parent is intentionality. He advocates blocking time for family or friends and being fully present, planning activities away from screens to truly connect. "If mom and dad aren't good, the kids want one thing, mom and dad to be good."

### Hack 4: Defend Your Downtime
Burnout from overwork taught the speaker the value of downtime as a creative process. He recommends blocking hobby time on calendars, choosing physical and mentally challenging hobbies, and making these sessions recurring. "Consistency compounds," he insists, stressing the importance of habitual leisure.

### Hack 5: Never Eat Alone
Inspired by Keith Ferrazziâ€™s book, he uses meals and physical activities like hiking to network and build relationships, proving even introverts can connect deeply. Loose ties often lead to the biggest opportunities. He skillfully curates gatherings, creating new networks frequently.

### Hack 6: Avoid the Dragon
The environment shapes behavior more than willpower. By removing junk food from immediate reach and relocating distractions like video games, he makes the good choice the only choice. This strategic avoidance reduces wasted evenings.

### Hack 7: Do an Evening Reset
He promotes using tools like the 5-minute journal to reflect on daily wins and lessons, review goals multiple times daily, and plan tomorrow's priorities with his wife. This routine reduces stress and clarifies focus. "You can't hit a target that you can't see."

### Hack 8: Set a Bedtime Alarm
A novel concept to many is setting an alarm to go to bed, ensuring sufficient rest for early rising without snooze. Early mornings depend on evening decisions. "People see me post at 4 in the morning; I get up without an alarm because I go to bed at 9:00."

### Conclusion
The speaker emphasizes that evenings are where winners are made. By implementing these small but powerful changes, anyone can drastically improve discipline, productivity, and quality of life, turning wasted time into meaningful growth and connection.

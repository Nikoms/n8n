### Introduction
In this rich conversation, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon VP and experienced executive coach, shares actionable insights on career growth, leadership, invention, and overcoming failure. Drawing from his 15 years at Amazon, including inventing Prime Video and other services, Ethan reveals his "magic loop" method to career advancement, Amazon's leadership principles, and candid stories about navigating challenges including a high-profile failure.

### The Magic Loop: A Career Growth Strategy
Ethan introduces the "magic loop," a simple 5-step process for career progression:

1. **Do your current job well.** Solid performance is a prerequisite for growth.
2. **Ask your manager how you can help.** Few employees do this, and it builds rapport.
3. **Carry out what your manager asks,** even if it's mundane.
4. **Return with aligned offers:** Ask how you can help in ways that also advance your goals.
5. **Repeat continuously** to build trust and demonstrate partnership.

This loop works especially well when managers are busy or less attentive, giving employees control over their growth. Over time, it transitions from explicit asks to proactive problem-solving, especially at senior and executive levels where trust and judgment are key.

### Overcoming Stagnation at Senior Management
Ethan discusses challenges managers face getting promoted beyond L7/M1 levels. Reasons include role scarcity and a need to shift from operational excellence to strategic influence. His advice includes:
- Patience and awareness of organizational needs.
- Building Next Level skills through strategic projects.
- Being the go-to person when peers are let go.

### The Nature of Invention
Drawing from his Amazon experience and Jeff Bezos's philosophy, Ethan shares that invention involves expertise, dedicated focus time (e.g., two hours monthly), and combining existing ideas innovatively. He highlights how big inventions like Prime shipping or the Kindle are decades-old but continuously optimized to this day.

### Interviewing Advice
Ethan emphasizes enthusiasm and professional appearance as critical factors. Beyond that, candidates must demonstrate impact by explaining why their work mattered rather than just what they did.

### Managing Failure with Jeff Bezos
Ethan recounts a failure launching Amazon's App Store where a key feature malfunctioned, causing Jeff Bezos's frustration. His key lessons:
- Own the problem immediately.
- Communicate updates proactively and frequently.
- Work intensively to fix issues.
- Rebuild trust through transparency and human interaction.

Despite the failure, Ethan was promoted two years later, demonstrating resilience and growth.

### Amazon Leadership Principles
Ethan contributed language to the "Ownership" principle, famously stating "An owner never says that's not my job." He also praises "Bias for Action," emphasizing speed and calculated risk-taking as vital in competitive environments.

### Contrarian Views
Ethan is skeptical about mandates to return fully to offices, citing centuries of evolution in office work and the untapped potential of remote work improvements. He also favors trust-based dealings over contractual legalism.

### Lightning Round Highlights
- Recommended books: *Decisive,* *Leadership and Self-Deception,* and *The Almanack of Naval Ravikant.*
- Favorite shows: Taylor Sheridan dramas like *Yellowstone.*
- Favorite interview question: Asking candidates about a time they disagreed with management.
- Favorite product: The "Chuck It" dog ball thrower.
- Life motto: "To whom much has been given, much will be required," emphasizing social responsibility.

- Software architecture involves constant trade-offs.
- Analyze trade-offs by linking business drivers to architectural characteristics.
- Example business driver: time to market, linked to maintainability, testability, deployability.
- Scenario 1: Single payment service risks larger testing scope and deployment risk; separate services reduce these.
- Scenario 2: Adding new payment types is easier with separate services (extensibility).
- Scenario 3: Users using multiple payment types better handled by a single service for performance and consistency.
- Trade-offs boil down to prioritizing performance and consistency vs. maintainability and extensibility.
- Decision depends on business needs; in the example, separate services fit business drivers better.
- Modern trade-off analysis requires understanding business drivers and corresponding architectural features.
- Future lessons will explore trade-off analysis in other architectural decisions.

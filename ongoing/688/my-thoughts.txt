A solid reminder of core Domain-Driven Design principles, especially the importance of ubiquitous language and value objects to make code more expressive and aligned with the domain. The video highlights practical challenges consultants face applying full DDD and focuses on pragmatic techniques to adopt its benefits without rigid adherence. It also covers how layering and architectural patterns like ports and adapters support clear boundaries, while anti-corruption layers help manage integration with external systems. Overall, it reinforces that the goal of DDD is creating code that solves domain problems clearly and sustainably, not just following technical patterns for their own sake.

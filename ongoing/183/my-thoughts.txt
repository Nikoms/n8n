The video explains how a well-designed DSL is crucial for writing robust acceptance tests that remain stable despite system changes. By separating the test cases' business-focused language from the underlying implementation through layers, the same tests can be applied across different interfaces—whether end-to-end or unit level—without needing to know the technical details. This four-layer approach ensures tests focus on what the system should do, not how it does it, improving maintainability and reusability.

The video highlights that the DSL is crucial for writing robust acceptance tests by abstracting the test cases from how the system works. This approach allows the same test cases to apply across different types of tests—whether end-to-end or unit—without changing their intent. By organizing tests into a four-layer architecture, with the DSL serving as the bridge between business requirements and system interaction, tests become more maintainable and reusable despite system changes.

The video explains that the key to creating robust acceptance tests lies in using a Domain Specific Language (DSL) that focuses on what the system should do rather than how it works. By organizing tests through a layered architecture—test cases in domain language, the DSL for expressing behaviors, protocol drivers that translate to system interactions, and the system under test itself—you can write tests that remain stable despite system changes. This approach allows the same test scenarios to be reused across different interfaces or test types, whether end-to-end or unit tests.

- Acceptance tests focus on what the system should do, not how it works.
- Fragility in acceptance tests arises when small system changes break tests.
- A four-layer approach separates concerns to make tests robust and maintainable.
- The four layers are: Test Cases (problem domain language), DSL (domain-specific language), Protocol Drivers (interface translation), and System Under Test.
- DSL provides reusable, abstracted behaviors to write test cases efficiently.
- Protocol Drivers translate abstract actions into real system interactions, isolating system-specific details.
- This separation enables reuse of tests across different interfaces and scenarios.
- Internal DSLs (e.g., in Java) are preferred but external DSLs like Gherkin can also be used.
- Example used: Buying a book from Amazon demonstrating this layered, abstract testing approach.
- The method helps keep acceptance tests stable and focused despite system evolution.

- Leverage is doing more with less effort, applicable to career growth.
- Three high leverage career skills: document accomplishments effectively, improve interviewing skills, and learn to say no wisely.
- Use a brag document to record impactful achievements for future use in reviews, resumes, and interviews.
- Interviewing sharpens active listening, communication, and calibration skills, and should be practiced regularly but prepared for.
- Saying no protects your limited attention; say yes only when the benefit outweighs the effort or impact is high.
- Avoid common pitfalls like inconsistent documentation, neglecting interview prep, and saying yes too often without impact.

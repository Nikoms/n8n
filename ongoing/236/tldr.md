- Frequently overlooked architectural characteristics include feasibility, observability, agility, and modularity.
- Feasibility involves considering time, budget, team skill set, and experience constraints before designing solutions.
- Observability is critical for measuring and tracking architectural goals and should be integrated early, not added later.
- Agility refers to the ability to quickly respond to change, involving maintainability, testability, deployability, and evolvability.
- Modularity is key for breaking functionality into manageable pieces and applies to both distributed and monolithic architectures.
- These characteristics are often undervalued by junior architects despite their importance alongside operational characteristics like scalability and responsiveness.

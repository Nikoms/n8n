### The Challenge of Interview Preparation While Working Full-Time
Steve highlights the reality many face: preparing for technical interviews while holding a full-time job is essentially another full-time job. He explains how the vast amount of content—from data structures and algorithms to system design and behavioral questions—can be overwhelming. Instead of trying to master everything, Steve emphasizes the importance of being intentional and focusing on areas that truly need improvement. He warns against starting preparations blindly or attempting to cover every topic exhaustively, which can lead to burnout and confusion.

> "It would be a gigantic mistake to prepare for interviews by repainting your entire house."

### Targeted Preparation and Efficient Time Use
Steve uses the analogy of spot painting walls marked by his toddler to describe targeted learning: address only the most critical areas, not everything. He advises against reading textbooks cover to cover or solving every problem in an ordered list. Instead, assess your strengths and weaknesses honestly, focusing time on the areas that will deliver the highest return on investment.

Combining interview preparation with everyday activities is another key tip. For example, Steve shares how listening to audiobooks while caring for his kids allows him to fit learning into his busy schedule.

> "Audiobooks have been a GameChanger in terms of feeding my appetite for books."

### Leveraging Work Experience in Interview Prep
Steve suggests finding the intersection between your current work and interview prep. For instance, if concurrency is both a subject in your interviews and relevant to your job, deepening your knowledge benefits both fronts simultaneously. Highlighting your achievements during performance reviews can also provide valuable anecdotes for behavioral interview questions, reducing duplicated effort.

> "If you spend a bit of time thinking about it, your work activities and your interview prep do intersect in places and represent high leverage activities."

### Right-to-Left Planning: Work Backwards from the Interview Date
One of the most important strategies Steve discusses is planning your preparation timeline backwards from your target interview date, a practice he learned at Amazon. This ensures that all necessary topics are covered in a time-bound fashion so that you peak on the actual interview day rather than too early or too late.

He contrasts this with left-to-right planning, which causes many to waste time on less critical areas or cram last minute. Using a physical calendar to block out your interview date and working back day-by-day helps maintain focus and pacing.

> "The best way to know whether you're ready to interview is by actually doing interviews."

### Mock Interviews and Milestones
Scheduling mock interviews or trial interviews with tier 2 companies before your main interview helps assess readiness and improve performance. Steve stresses the importance of being in interview shape ahead of mock interviews to avoid wasting time.

He recommends dedicating 5–10% of your preparation time purely to planning. For example, with 3 months to prepare, spend about 5 days organizing your approach, setting milestones, and identifying potential scheduling conflicts.

### Don't Neglect Behavioral Interviews
While the technical part is crucial, Steve cautions that behavioral interviews can greatly impact your chances of success. Poor storytelling or behavioral responses can result in being down-leveled or missing out on lucrative offers.

### Additional Resources
For more on behavioral interviews, Steve refers to his video on storytelling techniques. For those struggling to find a job, he also offers a video outlining strategies to get hired.

your job sucks and you need out now you wake up in the morning and dread the idea of having to deal with another day of the same garbage your workplace is toxic your co-workers suck and your manager has his head in the clouds and of course the pay is terrible you need a new job but you can't quit because you need the money and so you're handcuffed to work where you're wasting away you haven't interviewed in years what do they even ask nowadays you're barely finishing all of your tasks at work there's just no time to brush up on your skills it doesn't have to be this way in this video I'll go over what I would do if I was trying to prepare for the interview while holding a full-time job if you're new to the channel welcome my name is Steve Winn and I'm an L7 principal software engineer at Amazon I make videos that I wish existed when I was coming up in the industry if you'd like more of this type of content sign up for my Weekly Newsletter or join my Discord if you want to chat with a growing community of ambitious technology professionals before I get to my first point I'd like to talk about the fundamental problem with your situation preparing for interviews while you have a job is a full-time job on its own the only thing worse than your job right now is adding a bunch of work on top of it there's just so much to prepare for for coding problems there's just so many questions there's the blind 75 the grind 75 the KN code 150 Le code has thousands of problems now if you're a senior plus and need to prepare for system design now you've got textbooks of content you need to internalize and on top of all of this you need to prepare for soft questions as well how the heck do you know when you're ready like ready ready well I'll tell you how not to do it I have a 2-year-old and she just discovered that she can write on the walls in permanent marker in every room of the house now luckily she didn't get all of the walls and she's pretty short so she didn't get the tall places but we need to repaint and so we're going to paint over where she made the marks I could remove all of the furniture in the house and paint over everything but that would take forever cost a lot more money in supplies and more importantly be a bunch of Hassle and take a ton of time the very resource that I don't have a lot of and so we're going to spot paint over the marks and maybe paint like one wall that needs to be spruced up anyways and that's my first point you need to spend your time on identifying and targeting the areas where you need the most help and you need to be intentional about the things that you won't be preparing for just as much as the things that you need to prepare for it would be a gigantic mistake to prepare for interviews by repainting your entire house do not open up your copy of Designing data intensive applications and read it cover to cover do not prepare with Le code questions by starting from the first one and solving the questions in numerical order it may feel like being thorough would be a good thing right if you reviewed it all then you're guaranteed coverage the problem with being thorough with preparation though is that you're battling two things that can turn into rat holes breadth and depth when it comes to breadth where do you stop should you learn machine learning and AI should you pick up rust or the newest JavaScript framework maybe you should learn some embedded system stuff it's unbounded and you can go off the deep end when it comes to depth it's the same thing where do you stop the first link for the Wiki page for Dyer's algorithm leads to the wiki for algorithm which leads to mathematics which leads to the wiki on knowledge which leads to declarative knowledge which leads to awareness which links to philosophy which goes to ancient Greek and then the wiki for Greek language also you might get stuck in a loop if you're not careful like if you went to the Wiki page for a recursion so how do we avoid painting the entire your house and to Target the things that we absolutely need to work on one way is with today's video sponsor formation formation is the world's first AI powered technical interview prep program for experienced software engineers in the US or Canada looking to level up their software engineering careers formation has just launched a free technical interview Readiness assessment that software Engineers can take to uncover their exact technical skills weaknesses and the specific companies they're ready to interview at now I'm not looking for a job right now quite the opposite I just quit my job and retired from software development but I decided to take the test anyways to see what I should be working on if I were to prepare for interviews all right looks like I got a score of 771 I'm likely ready for data structures and algorithms questions as by the following companies my breakdown is I guess I'm a beginner in ADV raise advanced in link list intermediate with recursion I can probably improve in dynamic programming that's not a surprise to me it looks like they've put together a plan for me for what would happen if I signed up for formations program mock interviews daily standup concept drills for PA programming so it seems like it's putting together a pretty good decent plan the reason I accepted formation as a sponsor is because they take a high touch and personalized approach to preparing for interviews based on the assessments they'll come up with an intensive plan tailored to you and humans will work directly with you until you get your next gig alumni from their programs in 2023 increase their salary on average $82,000 a year so if you're looking for a new job and want to maximize your chances of Landing that next level gig head on over to formation by clicking on the link in the description to take their free online assessment thanks again to formation for sponsoring today's video so let's say you've done the work of identifying what you need to work on and it turns out dang there's a lot and even though we've limited the things that we need to cover that list is still going to take our precious time not just raw time but Focus time that's going to Tire you out and this is all while work is really grinding you so what to do how to make the most of your awaking hours when I get home from the office I have to put in a shift of child care for my two kids I don't mind doing it most days I have to do my part but what I found is that I started to run out of time for one of my passions reading then it dawned on me that I could listen to Audi books you know how sometimes you think you're really smart but then a really obvious thing takes forever to think of that was me with audiobooks when all I'm doing is bouncing a bouncer or while I have to console a crying baby in the middle of the night I'm usually good for 1 to 2 hours of listening to books now you can say that audio books aren't really reading they are at least to me but it's been a GameChanger in terms of feeding my appetite for books and that's my next point about preparing for interviews you want to see if there's an intersection between what you do for work and preparing anytime that you can kill two birds with one stone you want to leverage those opportunities for example right now it's the beginning of the year a common time for performance reviews and as part of performance reviews you want to highlight your achievements from the past year Well when you're interviewing you want to come up with good examples of your experience for the behavioral and soft questions describing your good work during performance review season will help you when updating your resume and preparing for interviews you may be needing to brush up on concurrency for interviews and the system that you work on may also lean heavily on concurrency researching and learning more about concurrency at a deep level can benefit both your work and your interview prep and you can push this as far as you're comfortable grinding leak code questions and work hours is a gray area that not everybody is okay with but maybe you volunteer to do some interviewing for your team so the leak coding is about research right the point is I think that if you spend a bit of time thinking about it your work activities and your interview prep do intersect in places and if they do it represents a high leverage activity that you should lean into you want to peek at the right time which is the day of the interview for your top tier companies if you Peak too early you may not be able to line up the interviews in time if you PE too late you won't be able to Showcase your best so how do you do it well there's a technique that I learned at my time at Amazon that's dead simple when you say it out loud but you would be surprised how many people don't employ it and actually just do the exact opposite another group of people that want to peek at the right time are Fighters if you're a fighter you want to Peak the day of the big fight so that means that you need to make weight the day before so you might know that you need to essentially starve yourself in the days leading up to the weigh-in to minimize the chance of injury your Peak intensity training should taper that week while you're cutting weight which means that the peak intensity training should occur a couple weeks before the taper starts which means that you need to start conditioning and a nutrition regimen months before Peak intensity training to ramp up you get the idea compare that to a fighter that has a match in the upcoming months and his plan is to Simply work on his biggest weakness and so he works on his footwork to get it up to his standard after that he works really hard on endurance but then because he's neglected other skills his speed has taken a hit and now the weigh-in is coming and the fight is rapidly approaching the only things that he can do now are drastic and the equivalent of cramming for the interview and that's my point the first fighter employed the technique of working backwards from the date of the big fight otherwise known as right to left planning the second fighter employed left to right Planning by working on the most important things first the big problem with left to right planning is that there's no regulator to make sure that the preparation is time Bound in a way that will have all of the things that you have to prepare for completed simultaneously working backwards from the date is is a very common Amazon practice and something that I highly recommend that you lean into get a physical calendar out and circle the date where you want to schedule all of your interviews that's the date that you want to Peak and start working your way back to today's date I think that the best way to know whether you're ready to interview is by actually doing interviews so what you might want to do is attempt to schedule some tier 2 company interviews before the main event so maybe you want to schedule mock interview some weeks before that which means that you need to be in interview shape before the mock interview so you aren't wasting in time and money you get the idea you might be saying to yourself duh Steve of course you should be working backwards from a date look at Mr Amazon man over here talking about this mind-blowing concept of right to left planning like he invented the transistor look I wouldn't even bring it up if I didn't notice people I know doing the complete opposite I can't tell you the amount of people I know that say yeah I'm going to start preparing for interviews by firing up leode and staying stuck on the same dynamic programming question for 2 weeks when the interview comes they go straight into cramming mode and the net effect is that they don't show the their best stuff and that's a big shame the reason I know people don't work backwards from the get-go is that planning takes a lot of time and energy and so the default is to just start working on things that they know that they have to work on but that's not the smart way to do it I think it makes a ton of sense to spend a minimum of 5% and optimally 10% of your allotted time to prepare for interviews to dedicate towards planning suppose you plan to give yourself 3 months to prepare for interviews that's about 90 days give or take spending about 5 days figuring out what you need to focus your attention on breaking up your preparation into bite-sized chunks setting effective milestones and looking ahead for scheduling conflicts and things that might upend your preparation seems about right to me for preparing for a highquality plan if you had me bet on which person I think would do the best with their interviews someone that employed right to left planning and stayed organized versus someone that just worked on their biggest weaknesses I would bet on that first person the technical part of the interview is important but you shouldn't sleep on the behavioral interview it could be the reason you get down leveled and lose out on hundreds of thousands of dollars

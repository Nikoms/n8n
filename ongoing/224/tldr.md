- Information overwhelm is a common problem from consuming vast amounts of content daily.
- Building a second brain is a digital system for capturing, organising, distilling, and expressing ideas to handle information overload.
- The 'CODE' framework stands for Capture, Organise, Distill, and Express.
- Digital note-taking apps like Apple Notes or Notion enable efficient idea storage and retrieval.
- Organising information by actionability (e.g., project-based) is more effective than organising by source/type.
- Progressive summarization helps highlight the most important parts of notes.
- Expressing knowledge through creation (videos, presentations, writing) is the ultimate goal of second brain.
- The system enables slow burns on multiple projects, reducing stress and improving productivity and creativity.
- Examples include preparing talks quickly and managing ongoing book or video projects.
- Digital commonplace books build on historical practices but leverage technology for searchability and organisation.

- Modularity is about breaking systems into smaller, separately deployed units of software, while granularity refers to the size of those pieces.
- Architectural modularity improves maintainability by making it easier to locate and apply changes.
- Testability benefits from modularity by reducing the scope and number of tests needed after changes.
- Deployability improves because smaller modules reduce deployment ceremony, increase frequency, and lower risk.
- Scalability is more efficient as only needed parts are scaled instead of the whole system.
- Fault tolerance improves since failure in one module does not bring down the entire system.
- Excessive coupling between modules negates these benefits, leading to integration issues and scaling problems.
- Granularity must be carefully managed to avoid pitfalls despite modularity benefits.

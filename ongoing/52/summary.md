# The Dead Simple Reason You're Not Getting Promoted (Ex-Amazon Principal Engineer)

## TLDR;

- Getting promoted in tech is less about technical skills and more about proactive career management.
- The key is taking control: explicitly communicate your promotion goals with your manager.
- Waiting passively for promotions leads to delays and missed opportunities.
- Understand your next level criteria and address skill gaps rather than just excelling in your current tasks.
- Be willing to have direct, sometimes uncomfortable conversations about promotion and career growth.
- Don’t postpone your promotion effort; applying sooner often yields better results.

### Introduction
Getting promoted in tech often surprises people because it has little to do with just technical skills or leadership abilities alone. After working with hundreds of tech professionals, I've found that a fundamental trait separates those who easily move up from those who don't. This article reveals this insight and provides three concrete ways to accelerate your promotion.

### The Promotion Ride Share Analogy
Imagine being on a frustrating ride share where your house is right ahead, but the driver keeps passing it to drop off others first. This illustrates how many tech workers passively wait their turn for promotion, hoping someone else will decide when it's their time. The truth is, you don’t have to wait — you can take control and "get your own car."

### Taking Control of Your Career
Taking control means you stop waiting for recognition or for your manager to notice your hard work. It means making your intentions crystal clear by directly telling your manager: "I want to get promoted and would like to work with you to understand what it would take." This conversation can lead to three different outcomes:
1. Support and help from your manager.
2. Feedback and a plan to improve.
3. Resistance, which indicates the need to seek a supportive environment or new manager.

### The Importance of Direct Communication
Many avoid this conversation out of fear or cultural conditioning. However, managers are not mind readers and often wait for employees to take initiative. If asking directly feels uncomfortable, frame the conversation as discussing career growth instead. Bring documentation of your current and next-level expectations to guide an informed discussion.

### Moving Beyond Current Skills
As shown through the story of "Ben," a strong coder stuck at senior level, excelling at your current role is not enough. Promotion requires demonstrating readiness for bigger scope projects, leadership at a broader scale, and strategic thinking beyond just technical problem solving. Review your company's leveling criteria, acknowledge skill gaps, and work on them.

### Don't Wait to Apply
Like surge pricing in ride shares, delaying putting in a promotion packet can cost you time and money. Waiting for the "perfect moment" or "big project" often leads to missed opportunities. Applying early and getting feedback is better than waiting indefinitely, because you confirm your progress and open doors sooner.

### Final Thoughts
To get promoted faster, make your promotion intentions known early, have hard but necessary conversations, understand and work toward next-level skills, and act now rather than later. Avoid postponing your growth and take control of your tech career journey.

- A well-known web-based company transitioned from a mini-waterfall process with long lead times to using pair programming for feature development.
- Initially, average development time per feature was 151 hours with pull request cycles taking 253 hours.
- Code reviews on large pull requests were ineffective, often yielding fewer comments as change size increased.
- 30% of features started to be developed with pair programming, allowing those features to skip code reviews.
- After 100 days using pair programming, average feature development time dropped from 151 to 44 hours, median from 44 to 22 hours.
- Bug counts decreased and software quality increased with pair programming.
- Pull request cycle time reduced from 253 to 130 hours by eliminating many queues and delays.
- Further improvements are being explored, including trunk-based development, TDD, and acceptance test-driven development.
- Pair programming is shown to yield better quality, fewer bugs, and faster delivery despite initial managerial concerns.
- Emphasizes running all tests faster rather than avoiding tests to reduce risk of bugs.
- Encouragement to try pair programming due to its proven benefits and positive impact on team culture.

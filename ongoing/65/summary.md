### Introduction
In this detailed conversation, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon vice president and executive coach, shares invaluable insights on career growth, invention, leadership, and handling failure. Drawing on his 15 years at Amazon—where he helped invent and lead critical programs including Prime Video and Twitch Commerce—Ethan offers practical advice rooted in experience.

### The Magic Loop: A Career Growth Method
Ethan explains the "Magic Loop," a simple five-step process designed to help professionals advance their careers regardless of managerial quality:

1. **Do your current job well.** It's essential to perform solidly before seeking advancement.
2. **Ask your manager how you can help.** This shows initiative and builds partnership.
3. **Follow through on what your manager asks.** Even mundane tasks help build trust.
4. **Revisit with your goals.** Communicate your aspirations and ask how you can help in ways that develop those skills.
5. **Repeat the loop continuously.** Constant, proactive partnership with your manager facilitates growth.

This process is especially crucial when managers are busy or not proactive about employee growth. It empowers employees to take control of their career trajectories.

### Career Development Challenges for Senior Managers
Ethan touches on the common challenge of being "stuck" at the senior manager level. Moving to director or VP requires a shift from execution to greater influence, coordination, and strategic thinking. While patience is sometimes necessary due to organizational constraints, practicing next-level skills and demonstrating capacity can help one become "the person" chosen for promotion opportunities.

### Systematic Inventiveness
Ethan emphasizes that invention is more about consistent effort and expertise than sudden inspiration. By dedicating focused time (even just two hours once a month) and combining known ideas innovatively, one can become an effective inventor. Examples include his drone delivery patent inspired by aircraft carriers.

He also points out that many of Amazon's major ideas—like Prime Shipping—are still evolving decades later, highlighting that optimizing and refining inventions is as important as the original idea.

### Handling Failure with Jeff Bezos
Ethan shares a vivid story about a launch failure of Amazon's App Store that angered Jeff Bezos. Key lessons from managing this crisis include:

- Owning responsibility immediately.
- Proactively communicating frequent updates.
- Seeking help to resolve technical issues.
- Facing leadership transparently, rebuilding trust over time.

Despite the public failure, Ethan was promoted two years later, showing that mistakes can be overcome with the right approach.

### Amazon Leadership Principles
Ethan helped shape Amazon's Leadership Principle of "Ownership," encapsulated by the phrase "an owner never says that's not my job." This principle emphasizes personal responsibility regardless of role boundaries. He also values "Bias for Action," advocating speed and decisiveness balanced with appropriate risk.

### Contrarian Perspectives
Ethan shares contrarian views, notably skepticism about returning fully to office work due to limited potential for office innovation compared to remote work. He also values trust-based business relationships over heavily contract-driven ones, acknowledging some risk but highlighting the benefits of faith in others.

### Interview and Career Advancement Tips
For interviewees, Ethan advises showing enthusiasm, presenting impactful outcomes rather than just activities, and being fully engaged (especially in virtual interviews). For those stuck in roles, he encourages practicing leadership skills ahead of being promoted and leveraging opportunities to demonstrate readiness.

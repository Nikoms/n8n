- The best way to pass an Amazon interview is to be genuinely skilled and know how to answer questions well.
- Knowing and understanding Amazon's leadership principles (LPs) helps but is secondary to genuine skill.
- "Leaders are Right A Lot" is often misunderstood in hierarchical cultures as blind obedience rather than encouraging leaders to do the work and be right.
- Many LPs have common misconceptions or 'degenerate cases,' like frugality being mistaken for saying no to all expenses.
- "Disagree and Commit" involves a three-step process: disagree openly, back your stance with data, then commit fully once a decision is made.
- Effective disagreement is expected, particularly with peers over priorities and upward to leadership.
- LPs can conflict or be weaponized; leaders should navigate these tensions thoughtfully.
- Interview success stems from answering behavioral questions authentically and demonstrating leadership through past experiences.
- Leadership principles push leaders to think beyond their narrow roles and take ownership for broad business success.
- Confidence and authenticity in interviews are more impactful than mechanical LP answers.

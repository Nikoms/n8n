the best way to pass an Amazon Interview is to be really skilled like be good yes then knowing how to answer the questions and being familiar with the leadership principles is the icing on the cake what what do you think is the most misunderstood LP by candidates the one that was classically pointed out as being misunderstood is there's a leadership principle are right a lot leaders are write a lot uh and Amazon did some research long time back now so maybe it's changed some but they found in the US that was understood what I'll call correctly as um leaders are expected to do the work to be right a lot in some other cultures that are more hierarchical and that have more of a uh an obey Your Leader Vibe it was taken as like oh yes of course we're being told to to just the leader is always obey the leader obey the leader and so a leadership principle is how well do you understand that the leader is right no matter what you think which is in fact the exact opposite of what Amazon was hoping for they were hoping to put pressure on the leader to do the work to make sure they're right and what they ended up doing in certain cultures particularly India in this case was telling people yeah the leader is right so don't ask questions which is exactly what they didn't mean um so I think that one is often misunderstood or can be um I think frugality is an easy one that's often misunderstood um uh because frugality means spend money carefully but people do what we call fluidity um where where the easiest way to be frugal is or to look frugal is just say no to all expenses and that's actually a terrible idea so I believe most leadership principles have what I call degenerate cases um I think think big is really hard to understand because think big doesn't explain too well right the full leadership principle is thinking small as a self-fulfilling prophecy leaders create and communicate a bold direction that inspires results they think differently and look around corners for ways to serve customers I think it's too easy to look at the words and think think big means I need to invent massive lofty thoughts like if I haven't invented PayPal or Tesla or or a cancer drug I'm not thinking big and that's not really what they mean um I think I I'm surprised you didn't say disagree and commit hey if you're enjoying this conversation about Amazon interviews be sure to check out exp bonus Amazon interview Prep course and engineering manager prep course with mock interviews and breakdowns of every single leadership principle uh great prompt uh of course it gets shorten to disagree and commit the whole principle says have backbone disagree and commit it is it's it's the only it's the only leadership principle that contains three steps in it um or two and a half steps and that's what confuses people is Step One is if you disagree speak up step two is even if the other person doesn't immediately accept what you say be willing to fight for what you believe and back it up and then step three is when a decision is made if that decision isn't the decision you believe is right get behind it and try and make it successful so I of course often look at this in the sense of a American football team and calling the play um I may think that we really really should throw a pass but in the Huddle if I'm like we should pass we should pass and you know the quarterback says nope I'm handing it off if I'm like if I go pout and I'm like well I'm not blocking then I'm guaranteeing that the run's gonna fail right and I may even feel good about that because I can stand back let the guy get tackled for a loss and be like see I was right um but of course I wasn't right because uh if I had done my part there's a better chance the Run might have worked now it could be that it was still not as good as a pass but exe you know there's this saying execution each strategy for breakfast so I think the commit part is tough and the hardest part about it I think is you're asking people to do something very difficult and stressful which is commit to taking action on a course of action they don't fully believe in and that has an on goinging cognitive and psychological cost now we're really talking about implementing the leadership principle though you're right it's complicated and easily misunderstood the way I always ask a question about that which was easily recognizable is tell me about a time where you had to implement a direction you didn't agree with and you should be able to talk about that whether or not you know this is the whole point about answer the question not imagine the leadership principle yeah yes yes and especially when you get a nice clear question like that the the the thing that I'm wondering is um for for different levels do you expect different types of stories for who they're disagreeing with in terms of someone oh how do you think about that ideal spread let's say for an for an ideal senior manager what's the ideal kind of disagreements you'd like to see in terms of someone above them someone on another team yeah the the two most common disagreements um the two most common disagreements are with a peer team over priorities right of of you know something is very urgent for you it may legitimately not be urgent for them and so then there's this question of uh how do you handle that because you need it right now but actually they may be doing the right thing for them to tell you yeah that's not on our priority list so now what um so I expect you to be able to talk about that uh and talk about how you resolve that how do you work around it how do you communicate it you know what are all the things you try to get the work done but then also how do you deal with it with your management if if they're not actually going to do the work like how do you escalate um and then of course upward the hardest thing is always to speak truth to power when do you have to go to someone above you and say I can't do that I expect leaders to know how to disagree effectively and respectfully I don't really care if you win or lose I care that you tried and that you um had your data and you made a good case uh and you came with options you know one of the things about this there really are fundamental disagreements that there's no third way to like make it all work but I'd say 80% of the time things that started disagree ments have Solutions with more cleverness I'm looking for leaders to show me that they at least attempted to be clever they didn't just fight what about um there's a there's an obvious tension between have backbone disagree and commit and earn trust at the senior manager level and above how do you parse the signal from the noise of that tension yeah it's really interesting I talked about how leadership principles have degenerate forms or they get they also get weaponized they get used as a club and one of the common defenses when you're disagreeing with me is for me to say you're not earning my trust right now oh wow yeah which is a thing right and and if someone said that to me I'd say well I'm sorry to hear that but I I want to address that headon um I'm disagreeing with you in a constructive way trying to get to a mutually beneficial solution I'm in conversation with with you about a difficulty we both have trying to find a way to make it win-win and if it can't be to make it the best outcome for the company that should be actually earning your trust that I'm dealing in good faith the earn trust I would just lecture the person even if they were above me and say earn trust doesn't mean do what you want it means deal with you openly and honestly from a place of mutual s Mutual best interest and I am doing that so if that doesn't work for you I'm sorry but I'm not going to change Amazon by the way lots of the leadership principles are set up to be in conflict with each other that's not the only one there's an acknowledgment um uh for example think big and dive deep can seem contradictory yeah totally be right a lot and biased for action for sure how I'm supposed to move really fast but never screw up how do I do that and and on and on um uh you know insist on the highest standards you know there's just a lot of things I'm supposed to invent well if I'm supposed to be write all the time invention has risk right uh invention is about making mistakes and lots of them in answering your questions I have like a meta point I want to make which is the best way to pass an Amazon Interview is to be really skilled like be good yes then knowing how to answer the questions and being familiar with the leadership principles is the icing on the cake but if you're thinking oh I need to like find a way to snow my way into this company through interview prep you kind of have the wrong idea right second second thing is um even within that go to the interview with a Viewpoint of I am confident in who I am and I'm going to share what I've done and let the interviewer sort of sort out uh these principles again don't get too much into managing the process instead if anything it is important to interview well but that's more about building Rapport um I don't know if this would be helpful to you but it might be my interview with Amazon for I came in on a flight some things happened and I ended up getting into my hotel room about 2 am um and needing to like get up to be at an 8 AM interview and with time to get dressed and whatever and so I gave up on my interview in one sense I gave up on my interview before going to bed I'm like well this is effed it's over but I didn't get depressed about it I was like well I'm gonna go through the motions I'm here I'm gonna do my best but I'm gonna be I don't expect an offer I've done half an all nighter it's is what it is turns out that was a great strategy because I went through the day stressfree the whole day I was like I'm not getting this job so whatever well then I wasn't stressed about anything and I just rolled with it and I actually I happen to know because someone told me I crushed the interview you know I had what's called an all- inclined Loop everyone was inclined and at the end of the loop not knowing this was happening they actually brought in my SVP to sell me and so I'm like at the end of this long interview day being really tired and it took me a bit to catch John he's like well what questions do you have I'm like I don't have any questions what do you need to know about me and it took me a little bit to catch on that they'd switch gears to selling and I wasn't doing a very good job engaging with the cell process so I switched gears and it was all fine the point is though I interviewed with some people that are you know semi legendary in the history of Amazon now well-known characters and I did it on four or so hours of sleep and I succeeded with no knowledge of I've never heard of an LP you know so don't feel like that's the key the key is answer the question and be engaged and forward obviously the leadership principles have changed your life and career uh give us a note to end on for for why that's true I think the leadership principles challenged me to be broad is is they challenged me to do things I didn't think were my job and so probably the hardest leadership principle for me I saw myself when I came to Amazon as a senior manager I had in mind my job is to build what I'm told I'm assigned to build something I build it if I build it well my job is done Amazon said not so not so fast um if you build it nobody wants it and the customers don't like it even though you were told to build it you as a leader have still failed you need to be engaged enough you built a working thing but you built a working useless thing and yes that useless thing is what somebody else ask you for that's still that's not enough that doesn't counted success that taught me to start thinking more broadly than just I am an engineer this is what I do it taught me to actually take ownership for the business success and for me that changed my life because I I stopped being an engineering leader and I started being a business leader and that totally changed my life um and that really was driven by oh crap they want me to actually think about that like they're they're saying it's part of my job not just to build but to build something useful amazing thank you Ethan no problem my my pleasure Kevin thank you for the chance to share [Music]

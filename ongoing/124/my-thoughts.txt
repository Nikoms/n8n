Consider investing in four key sectors for an approximately 4% return. Namely, shares in a market with growth but no inflation, gold for a growing and inflating market, cash for a stagnant yet inflating market, and government bonds for a depressed or deflationary market. These sectors all correspond to different economic scenarios, and when regularly rebalanced, can provide a commendable return with stability.

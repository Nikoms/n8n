- Architectural characteristics come from three main sources, especially the business domain.
- Understanding the problem domain helps identify critical characteristics like performance, data integrity, and elasticity.
- Business language often differs from architectural language, requiring architects to translate business needs into architectural qualities.
- User satisfaction translates to multiple architectural characteristics including performance, agility, security, availability, fault tolerance, recoverability, and testability.
- Time to market corresponds architecturally to maintainability, testability, and deployability.
- Architects should document critical characteristics and collaborate with product teams using tools like an architectural characteristics worksheet.
- Validating and getting buy-in on these characteristics is an ongoing communication process between architects and stakeholders.

# The Dead Simple Reason You're Not Getting Promoted (Ex-Amazon Principal Engineer)

## My thoughts

In this video, the speaker emphasizes that asking for a promotion directly is critical to career advancement. This fact resonates with me and I believe it's something everybody should be aware of. Waiting around will get you nowhere. Hence, I find it crucial to share this video.

## TLDR;

- Getting promoted in Tech is rarely about just technical skills, leadership, or communication.
- The key is taking active control of your promotion process rather than passively waiting.
- Make your promotion intentions crystal clear with your manager during one-on-ones.
- Promotions require demonstrating readiness for bigger scope, not just excelling at current tasks.
- Waiting too long or postponing requests can cost you opportunities and compensation.
- Have career growth conversations if you find it uncomfortable to directly ask for promotions.
- Use next-level criteria to identify and close gaps with your manager’s support.
- Don’t accept deflections or delays from managers; pursue other options if needed.

### Introduction
Promotions in Tech often aren't about your pure technical skill or even your leadership and communication abilities. From my experience working with nearly 500 Tech professionals, I've found the biggest difference is about mindset and proactive behavior.

### The Ride Share Analogy
Imagine being stuck in a ride share where your house is right there, but the driver keeps taking detours and never dropping you off. Waiting passively for your turn in the promotion queue is the same – you are the passenger. You have an option to take control but many don't realize it.

### Taking Control of Your Promotion
Getting promoted means taking the driver's seat in your career ride. It doesn’t mean waiting for recognition or hoping your manager notices your hard work. The language we use like "I got a promotion" is passive and misleading. You must *take* your promotion.

### Make Your Intentions Crystal Clear
The first rule is to explicitly tell your manager you want a promotion. Not hints or suggestions, but a clear conversation during your one-on-one: "I want to get promoted and would like to work with you to understand what it takes." 

Three things can happen:
- Your manager actively supports you
- They give concerns but collaborate
- They resist or postpone, which means you need to consider other options including finding a more supportive manager.

If you're uncomfortable, start with talking about career growth in general without using the word 'promotion'.

### Playing the Next Level Game
Technical excellence at your current level isn't enough. Look at Ben's story – a top coder stuck at Senior because he was playing a different game. To get promoted, you need to show readiness to handle bigger scope like cross-functional projects, architecture discussions, and business impact.

Use your company's level guidelines and discuss with your manager where you're missing skills. Don’t ignore gaps by just doing more of what you’re already good at.

### Don't Postpone Your Growth
Waiting for the "perfect" moment or project to apply for promotion can backfire. Like surge pricing that goes up while waiting, delaying your promotion request can cost you years and significant compensation.

Being proactive—even if the project is not perfect—is better than waiting indefinitely. I’ve seen highly qualified engineers get promoted quickly once they started the process.

### Manager Pushback and Delays
Managers often deflect by saying “Focus on the current project” or “Promotion talks later.” This is usually about avoiding extra work for them. You need to push through or switch teams if necessary.

### Conclusion
Your promotion is your responsibility. Have honest conversations, demonstrate readiness for the next level’s scope, and don’t wait passively. Taking the uncomfortable step to ask can unlock significant career acceleration.

### Final Note
If you're targeting Senior Engineer or beyond, situational awareness is key. Watch additional resources on why promotions might be delayed and how to fix that.

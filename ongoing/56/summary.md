# The Dead Simple Reason You're Not Getting Promoted (Ex-Amazon Principal Engineer)

## My thoughts

This is the summary of a study video I recently stumbled upon, titled "The Dead Simple Reason You're Not Getting Promoted (Ex-Amazon Principal Engineer)."

The major takeaway from this video is that obtaining a promotion in the tech field isn't so much about pure technical skills, leadership abilities or how well you can communicate with others. Instead, the video stresses the importance of adopting a proactive approach towards achieving your career goal -- your promotion.

One analogy that particularly stuck with me comes from the video, and it's the Ride Share Analogy. It perfectly encapsulates why actively pursuing your promotion is so crucial instead of passively waiting for it. It says imagine yourself in a ride share, your house is right there in sight, but the driver keeps looking for detours and never drops you off. That's exactly what it feels like waiting for your turn in the promotion queue -- you're just a passenger to the whole process.

Therefore, the video suggests that you should take control of the process. For instance, engage your manager in a frank discussion during one-on-ones to express your ambition and readiness for promotion. Take ownership of your career journey and, essentially, “take” your promotion.

The video further expounds on the importance of playing the Next Level Game which means proving that you’re ready to handle bigger tasks, not merely excelling at your current duties. The author advises not to delay your growth; waiting for the “perfect” moment can cost you as the promotion process could become more stringent over time.

Like the video, I agree that if your manager is not supportive or keeping pushing back, considering other options might be necessary. In essence, taking responsibility for your advancement is key.

The content of the video resonates with me, particularly the part about making it clear to your manager that you desire a promotion. If you never raise the topic, you might never receive the promotion you aspire for.

- The key is taking active control of your promotion process rather than passively waiting.

- Promotions require demonstrating readiness for bigger scope, not just excelling at current tasks.
- Waiting too long or postponing requests can cost you opportunities and compensation.

### Introduction
Promotions in Tech often aren't about your pure technical skill or even your leadership and communication abilities. From my experience working with nearly 500 Tech professionals, I've found the biggest difference is about mindset and proactive behavior.

### The Ride Share Analogy
Imagine being stuck in a ride share where your house is right there, but the driver keeps taking detours and never dropping you off. Waiting passively for your turn in the promotion queue is the same – you are the passenger. You have an option to take control but many don't realize it.

### Taking Control of Your Promotion
Getting promoted means taking the driver's seat in your career ride. It doesn’t mean waiting for recognition or hoping your manager notices your hard work. The language we use like "I got a promotion" is passive and misleading. You must *take* your promotion.

### Make Your Intentions Crystal Clear
The first rule is to explicitly tell your manager you want a promotion. Not hints or suggestions, but a clear conversation during your one-on-one: "I want to get promoted and would like to work with you to understand what it takes." 

Three things can happen:
- Your manager actively supports you
- They give concerns but collaborate
- They resist or postpone, which means you need to consider other options including finding a more supportive manager.

If you're uncomfortable, start with talking about career growth in general without using the word 'promotion'.

### Playing the Next Level Game
Technical excellence at your current level isn't enough. Look at Ben's story – a top coder stuck at Senior because he was playing a different game. To get promoted, you need to show readiness to handle bigger scope like cross-functional projects, architecture discussions, and business impact.

Use your company's level guidelines and discuss with your manager where you're missing skills. Don’t ignore gaps by just doing more of what you’re already good at.

### Don't Postpone Your Growth
Waiting for the "perfect" moment or project to apply for promotion can backfire. Like surge pricing that goes up while waiting, delaying your promotion request can cost you years and significant compensation.

Being proactive—even if the project is not perfect—is better than waiting indefinitely. I’ve seen highly qualified engineers get promoted quickly once they started the process.

### Manager Pushback and Delays
Managers often deflect by saying “Focus on the current project” or “Promotion talks later.” This is usually about avoiding extra work for them. You need to push through or switch teams if necessary.

### Conclusion
Your promotion is your responsibility. Have honest conversations, demonstrate readiness for the next level’s scope, and don’t wait passively. Taking the uncomfortable step to ask can unlock significant career acceleration.

### Final Note
If you're targeting Senior Engineer or beyond, situational awareness is key. Watch additional resources on why promotions might be delayed and how to fix that.

- Measuring productivity by lines of code, velocity, or utilization is flawed and often misleading.
- Effective productivity measurement relies on four key software delivery performance metrics: deploy frequency, lead time for changes, change failure rate, and time to restore service.
- Elite performers achieve faster deployments and higher stability simultaneously.
- Continuous delivery practices, lean management, and lean product development improve productivity and culture.
- A generative, psychologically safe culture is crucial for high performance and innovation.
- Individual productivity is about enabling focus and minimizing interruptions, not output volume.
- Reducing technical debt through architecture, maintainability, and monitoring enhances productivity and reduces burnout.
- Cloud adoption can significantly improve performance if done correctly, embracing on-demand self-service and automation.
- COVID-19 and remote work have not diminished developer productivity thanks to flexible tools and processes.

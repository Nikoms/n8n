how do people get promoted have you ever had an experience where you're really good at what you do you're reliable you're on time you're always getting your work done you're focused and people actually can depend on you but you see that others who seem less experienced or even less educated are getting promoted faster than you I've run four companies and hired over a thousand people today I want to share with you the four secrets of getting promoted that nobody will tell you the first habit is to switch from executing to advocating so a lot of people don't understand this but but executing is different than advocating for yourself and when most people want a promotion they think I'm going to execute more and that's what's going to get me the promotion but it's not actually more of this that gets you the promotion it's actually switching to something different which is learning to Advocate let me give you an example I say this to my team all the time which is if a tree falls in a forest but nobody sees it or hears it fall did it fall the same goes for doing work if you do work you don't tell anybody about the work you do and nobody sees the work you do then does the work get done in their minds from their perspective no for you you might be thinking I'm over here working my butt off why do people not understand what's going on and it's because you probably are phenomenal executor but you're not yet a phenomenal Advocate back when I had my company gym launch I had a director of our coaching program and he had moved up from being over sales to being over coaching and I saw that he was a phenomenal executor but I notic noticed that there were some discrepancies in terms of he was really great at execution but he wasn't the best advocate of himself and something that I noticed was I had brought in a CFO and that CFO a skill that she had was she wasn't just a phenomenal executor she was also a phenomenal Advocate and I'll give you some examples so one thing she did was that every time we met for a one-on-one She always told me here's the things I'm working on and so she would tell me what she did the last few days and she would also tell me what she was going to work on the next few days the second thing that she did is in every end of week report she had she put in great detail everything she did that week and so I would look at her end of week report and it was like the longest end of week report I've ever seen whereas this other guy who was tracking to be the head of the company he would maybe put three or four things in there and this is something that a lot of people struggle with is that they do a lot of work but they don't advocate for themselves and so they don't provide visibility for their boss and this is the thing is people think if I do more marketing I will become a marketing leader totally wrong if you do more marketing you become a better marketer if you want to be a better marketing leader you learn leadership and so if you want to be a marketing leader you start to learn how to advocate for yourself you start to learn how to communicate you don't learn more of how we do SEO How We Do funnels how we do because you're just keeping yourself stuck in the old job and so this is really important to understand if you want to get better at the current role you're at you focus on executing more if you want to move up into a lead leadership role then you want to focus on advocating for yourself communicating and acquiring those skills more marketing more operating more customer service more Finance isn't going to get you a leadership position and so more of the same keeps you stuck where you are the first level of value that you provide to a company is in the doing right this is where you're an Executor and this is where vast majority of the workforce is and this is where most people start off is they start giving value to the company by doing but the next level if you want to get promoted is to move up into the communicator realm now here's the thing a lot of people say I'm doing all this work but my boss is just running meetings and talking to people and doing these things and so they think that the work that they do is more valuable and get it I get it because guess what before I had my own companies I was a phenomenal executor and I didn't understand this I didn't even understand why it was that people in management got paid so much more think about this in order to be a salesperson you have to know certain skills you have to know how to persuade people you have to know how to be on time you have to know how to sell people how to pitch people how to build Report with people now if you want to be a sales manager you skill stack what is skill stacking that means that you don't just have those skills you have to learn how to persuade you have to know how to pitch you have to know how to build report how to be on time how to smile on a call but now if I want to be a sales manager I have to also learn how to lead a team how to train a team to build rapport how to train a team to persuade people how to get people to do things how to train people to be on time how to get people to audit their calls so now I've just taken all these skills and then I've stacked these skills on top of it and this is why being a communicator is more valued in the marketplace because there are so many more subskills that go into being a communicator than there are an Executor the first level is that you learn how to do it yourself but the next level is you learn how to get other people to do it and so a lot of people and I'll be honest it's much harder to get other people to do it if I wanted to go in and go run a sales team go run my finance team go run my HR team I could do it with my eyes closed what's much harder is getting people to do it the way I would want it done because not only do I have to know how it needs to be done but I have to know how to persuade people and also how to train people to do it in the way that I want it done and so if you're sitting there wondering I don't know I work more hours longer than my boss and I'm not getting promoted and I don't know why I'm not valued the same way this person is it's because you don't have as many skills we need to look at objectively people are compensated to the level of skills they have and how difficult it is to attain those skills a recent LinkedIn study found that communication is the most important skill for advancing in the workplace in fact about 90% of Executives attribute lack of communication to be the reason why people don't move up so if you're wondering why is my boss not promoting me there's a n out of 10 chance that's because because your communication is not there again more of the same is not going to get you to another level what got you here doesn't get you there another interesting stat is that employees who consistently Advocate and communicate their ideas are 32% more likely to be considered for a promotion now why is that let me tell you as somebody who has been considered for a promotion and also promoted hundreds of people it's because they don't know that you even have ideas seriously there's a lot of people right so say I have 10 people in my company and out of those 10 people none of them give me their ideas how do I know those ideas even exist how do I even know they have ideas in their head so if two people out of the 10 give me ideas one I immediately pay attention to those people two I see they have communication skills three I see that they have the ability to manage stress because they're coming to me and bringing me ideas that's telling me that they're pushing themselves they're pushing themselves out their comfort zones and then those other eight people I don't know do they have the communication skills do they have ideas do they think about their job in their free time I have no idea and so that is why people who speak up they advocate for themselves and they communicate are more likely to be promoted now I will say this as a boss I look at people who are quiet and I try to what I say is like use poll management to pull things out of them but I will tell you you will make it a hell of a lot easier on yourself and your boss to get promoted if you push it to your boss rather than expecting them to pull it from you to sum it up you don't need more technical skills to move up you need more soft skills so the question is what can you do to show that you advocate for yourself it's not about working more at your current job it's about working towards the next so here's what I want you to do trade doing more for talking more I call this executive presence with my team and I have these conversations all the time because it's a very frequent thing that people go through which is you're great at doing your job do do do all day I know how much you're doing I see how hard you're working but what you lack is executive presence what does an executive do what did my CFO do that you don't do she spoke up on meetings she provided with me with transparency she told me what she was working on she constantly shared ideas she constantly asked me questions she was constantly putting herself in the line of fire and so what I tell you to do right now is to not put more energy towards the doing continue doing what you are but to put your discretionary effort towards communicating and so here's what I would tell you to do do you have a meeting that you attend each tweak with your boss do you have a oneon-one that you attend with them do you have a report that you turn into them I want you to put triple the effort into it this time so if it's a meeting I want you to challenge yourself to speak up three times if it's a oneone I want to challenge you to come prepared to prepare ahead of time and to give them visibility into everything you did between that 101 and your last 101 and if you're really going for it this is what I tell people that are a little more advanced they've already got down the meetings in the 101s I want you to offer to do a presentation for the team what you're doing is you're putting yourself in a situation where you are learning those skills that leaders have and here's the thing everyone ask me they're like Lea how do I become a leader how do I get better at being an advocate rather than just an Executor by freaking doing it you don't get better by reading more books about hard conversations and presentations you get better by putting in the Reps at first you're going to suck then you're going to be okay then you're going to be good then you're going to be great and then one day you can excellent but it all starts with being okay sucking guys look at my first YouTube video I ever made dog and that's after running a company for 8 years it's kind of frightening but I said I'm not going to quit I'm not going to give up I'm going to keep going you have to put in the Reps and I'm telling you the only way to get these skills to move up in the company is by doing it and you're going to suck at first but that's okay because one day if you keep going you will be amazing the second habit you want to build to get promoted in the workplace is to switch from operating in just the now to operating in the now plus tomorrow if you want to grow in your role what you want to learn is how to pull the future into the present I want to give you two stories and examples of people that came into my last company I brought in a financial leader this person came in and the first thing that she did was she built out this is the vision for the Department this is what we need to be in 18 months here's the people I'm going to need to hire here's what the rules look like here are the processes we need to have in place and here are the outcomes we need to drop and she called this her North Star guiding document and so she used this every time she was making a decision every time she was planning the quarter and every time she was deciding to do something for a department this document was about 8 n pages long just how I make a vision document for my company showing us this is where we're going it was that for her department on the other hand I brought in a systems leader about the same time and that gentleman came in the first thing that he started doing was just doing work he started saying I'm just going to start doing the work he started taking on the work that was there and then I said where's the department going and he wasn't really sure it was very clear about 4 months in there was too much work for just him and he said do you think we should hire someone and I was like I mean yes but what's your hiring plan do you know what the team needs to look like like where are we going what are we going to need what are the systems do we have processes and he couldn't answer any of those questions what was the difference between those two leaders the difference was that that my financial leader was proactive while my systems leader was reactive the best leaders are constantly operating in the proactive successful leaders anticipate challenges and opportunities and then they guide their teams towards those future goals rather than just reacting to whatever is coming their way the reason why so many people don't get promoted is they cannot make it out of the execution spiral they don't take enough time to think to get themselves above the problem and they just do do do do do every problem gets solved with doing more fixing fixing fixing reacting reacting reacting and so they never take themselves out of their bubble I call it like the bubble of execution to get above the bubble of execution and go into the bubble of planning I think that the best leaders know how to operate Within These two places something I've had to learn over time is when I need to be in my execution bubble and when I need to be in my planning bubble the issue is that many people can only be in one or the other and you might know this if you're thinking of your colleagues or maybe leave' hired which is like you have some people who it's like they can think think think but they suck at doing anything and they never get their hands dirty half the team resents those people and they're like that  doesn't do whereas the other side there's people who are like doing do doing people like man they get so much done such a beast all stuff but you're like you know I think if you just took like a day you might be able to like prevent a lot of the problems you're fixing and here's the thing I have talked to so many people interviewed so many people who tell me about how they're in a job where they feel burnt out because they're just doing doing doing doing doing all the time and I've brought those people into my companies and what I've found is that they have trained themselves to be constantly doing doing doing and never getting above the doing this and so it's not that the job burned them out it's that they burned themselves out they burned themselves out because they don't realize that thinking is part of the job in order to get promoted you have to make time to think and get ahead of the department because think about it if you are not ah head of the department how does the department grow and if you're not growing the department who's growing the department it becomes your boss's job I can tell you this because I've had many leaders who come in and when I have one of those reactive leaders who's in this doing spy roll I have to do half their job I have to do their organizational planning I have to do their hiring forecasting I have to suggest what systems we use I have to tell them the things that they're not thinking about I have to do their strategic planning for them and then I recognize usually when I'm getting caught up oh this isn't my job it's actually that they have a lack or a deficit in theirs what I've recognized that until somebody can pull the future into the present and create that compelling vision for their department and really forecast and plan then they're not ready for that leadership role because the reality is if they spend all their time reacting where's their team their team is going to follow their cue and so they're going to create this execution spiral on their team which I don't want because I don't want people who feel like they're constantly reacting things they're constantly not able to predict their work and they're constantly in this state of like almost on the edge of burnout the thing is you set the pace of the team and so if you are behind consequently the rest of the team is behind and if you're ahead the team consequently is also getting ahead your job as a departmental leader or a leader of a function or even of a company is to bring the vision to life you're constantly making hard calls and prioritizing to make sure that you're focused on doing the right things the definition of industriousness which is one of the core things I look for in a leader is somebody who can work very hard on the right things it's not that you just work very hard lots of people work very hard but they work very hard on the wrong things have you ever felt like that where it's like you're constantly working super hard but nothing is moving forward it's because you're not taking the time to decide if you work on the right things in the right order and that my friend is the definition of strategy here's the thing if you're proactive your emphasis is on preparing and if you're reactive your emphasis is on repairing and so if you find yourself constantly repairing in your job I want to take a second to ask you this do you think if you took two days where you blocked your calendar and all you did was plan and all you did was think how could I get ahead and strategize and prioritize all the things that you're doing do you think it would make your life and your team's life easier if the answer is yes you should do that all day and by the way I do this all the time I put time on my calendar I did it this morning I blocked 3 days in the next 2 weeks because I knew that I'm getting close to an execution spiral and I need to get ahead of the things I'm doing to prioritize and prune my list so I can make sure that I get ahead the best leaders schedule their priorities rather than looking at their schedule and asking where do I fix hit my priorities in your priorities should be represented on your calendar and so this is a great place to start if you look at your calendar and you think wow I'm not moving anything forward this week guess what move it because that's what leaders do they move things forward and so if you want to get promoted to be a leader you too learn to move things forward it's really like instead of making 100 decisions you think 100 times about one decision and that is the essence of pulling the future into the present it's being more proactive it's being more mindful it's being more thoughtful listen when I first started in business I didn't do any of this okay I was just an Executor I was doing and then what I realized is that I spent all my time fixing mistakes that if I had just taken a little bit of time to think about I would have been able to prevent and so what I was doing when I was constantly in the repairing mode is I was giving my team Whiplash it was like problem over here problem over here problem over here we're going this way then that way then this way it's like they were also in this like frenetic energy bubble that I'd created and until I was able to get myself out of that bubble I couldn't get them so here's what you can do if this resonates with you and this is what I suggest people do when they're trying to move up in the company which is audit your time and what you do is I want you to take a week or take a month is even better guys I swear to you I still do this and I want you to color code your activities are they tactical or are they strategic and so what you can do by that is say you make tactical green and you make strategic blue and then you can visually see how much time do I spend thinking prioritizing strategizing versus doing and executing and often times what you'll find is if you're feeling very reactive is that you need to be able to say no to some of the fires that are popping up in order to say yes to Growing your department here's the third Habit to get yourself promoted management of time comes before management of self and management of self comes before management of others and so if you want to manage others and you want to get promoted learn first how to manage your time I'll give you an example of this I had a head of HR and this woman when she came in I suggested what kind of way do you man your calendar you know she's stepping in this role it's a lot more demands and she kind of shrugged off my suggestions and so what ended up happening was what I noticed is that her mood started going like this over time and it was like very erratic one day she was showing up great for the team the next day she was like pretty mean the next day she's like acting like a total I don't even know what and so I looked at a calendar and I said you have where's your gym time where's your family time when are you eating why are you taking 14 calls a day and she said I'm just I'm just trying to get everything done I want to blah blah blah and like and she was this ball of frenetic energy and so I told her I was like listen in order for you to move up it's not about doing more with your time it's it's about being more strategic with your time and being more thoughtful with your time because if you don't manage your time then you don't manage yourself and then you don't show up for your team and what happened because she wasn't showing up for her team is I had people coming to meet and they're saying do you know what's going on with her you know I don't want a tattletail but on this meeting she kind of yelled at me she kind of snapped and I'm thinking  what's going on and then when I looked at her calendar I was like of course you're not showing up well for your team because you can't even show up for yourself this is something that I did not understand when I first got into leadership I used to overbook myself I used to over schedule my time and I thought that managing my time meant getting more done than other people but managing my time as a leader actually means being more strategic with my time than other people and so what I recognized is that part of leadership is to influence everyone on my team and how I show up for them influences how they show up for themselves and for their peers so if I'm a ball of frenetic energy their balls of frenetic energy if I don't man my time they don't manage their time if I show up mad and frustrated they're probably all not going to have the best day and so if you want to learn how to manage others you first have to man yourself because nobody wants to work for a leader who shows up their worst self every day the thing is you have to let some fires burn so you can tackle the bigger ones to impress upon you the importance of this don't say you don't have enough time you have exactly the same amount of hours in the day that were given to Helen Keller Michael and Angelo Mother Teresa Leonardo da Vinci Thomas Jefferson and Albert Einstein so if you can't manage your time it's very unlikely that you can't manage yourself listen we all have the same amount of hours of the day it took me a long time to recognize this it's that a lot of us have other reasons why we can't manage our time which then means we can't manage ourselves which then means we definitely can't manage others those who Master managing their time and themselves can teach others how to manage their time and master themselves you remember what I said in the first part about skill stacking if you manage time you stack that onto managing yourself which Stacks with managing others but it comes with managing time if you don't manage your time you don't manage yourself and then you definitely can't manage other people if you can't even stick to your calendar and keep your commitments then what makes you think that you will be able to move up into a company where you are responsible for other people managing their own calendars and managing their own selves if you can't do it then what makes anybody think that you can help others do it for themselves it's like seeing something on the Internet and they're talking about how to build a company that's worth nine 10 figures whatever it might be but they've never had a company of nine or 10 figures I can't tell you how much that drives me mad because I'm like dude how are you supposed to teach people something that you've never done you don't know and so here's the thing the reason this is so important is because it takes a lot more energy to grow a company than it does to maintain a company and if you want to move up into a leadership position it is essential to know time management because you're expected not just to maintain things how they are today but to grow things to move things forward and if the leader of the department is not moving things forward who the is here's the thing the people who are the busiest in the company are not moving things forward in fact a lot of people who move things forward are not the busiest because what they do is they Outsource the bus work so that they can strategize and pull the future into the present the activities that I do that drive my company forward they're not in the busy work that is not where they are found the things that I do that drive the company forward are done on my days where I have the most time to work on things in silence they're done in the moments when I put a lot of effort into a presentation that I'm going to present to the team they're done in the moments where I've worked on something for the last two months and I'm finally going to bring it to my team to Launch a new division to launch a new product to bring on a new company it's in the hard work that takes time it takes thought and it doesn't do well with frenetic energy or mismanagement of time and here's the key to doing that the key is not to prioritize what's on your schedule but to schedule your priorities this is the rot of managing yourself when people say you know what I just don't have time for that like I really want to lose weight but I just don't have time to do it in my day honestly  you it is not that you don't have time Michelangelo Helen Keller Kobe Bryant Oprah Winfrey if you wanted to lose weight you would make the time your schedule is a reflection of your priorities whether you want it to be or not and whether it's because you're afraid of moving something you're afraid of saying no to somebody either way what that means is that you people pleasing is a bigger priority than you losing weight than you growing your company where your time goes is where your priorities are there are so many times where I have to tell people you know what I'm so sorry but I have to cancel this meeting I have to move this I can't meet this week it's not because it's not important if you want to be a leader of a department if you want to move up in a company you have to be the kind of person that can make happen and the first thing that you have to do to make  happen is you have to be willing to move around the only way that I make happen is I am completely flexible day to day I consider myself a chameleon I will wake up in the morning and I will look at my calendar and I will say you know what yesterday I thought these were priorities today I realize they're not this is actually more important for me to focus on and I will ruthlessly do that day after day after day if that hurtt some people's feelings that's okay because my job is to make sure this company keeps growing so that I can make sure everyone here has jobs and so I have to look out for my time because nobody else is going to do it for me great leaders have a clear vision and strategy for the future whether that be an entire company or one department they know where they want to take the department and they have a plan of how to get there they take that and they communicate that vision and that plan to key stakeholders and people all around them they can give the utmost Clarity for everybody else how do you do this my number one suggestion is doing something I call Monday hour one and this essentially is scheduling your priorities each week not looking at your schedule and thinking where the do I fit this in being the master of your schedule being the one who determines what's on your schedule every Monday and I would actually suggest Sunday so it's for me it's Sunday hour one is I go through I look at all of the things I have what happened last week what's happening next week where do I need to focus based on am I on track or off track with where I need to be with the entire company now for you this might be a department it might be a function or it might just be your job but the thing is that each week I use that time to make sure that I'm tracking towards success and if I'm not holding myself accountable to tracking towards success the likelihood I get there is basically none and here's the thing I actually made a video on how to do this so if you want to know more about how to schedule your calendar in this way go ahead and check this video out right here here's the next Habit to getting promoted is you want to remove friction you want to become a lubricator in the business rather than somebody who is a stopper in the business you either create friction or you reduce friction people who reduce friction get promoted so think about it like this if you take a lot of time from your current manager and they do not get a lot back from the time they've spent with you meaning the return on their time was low the likelihood you get promoted is low people who get promoted do more with less if for example you take 2 hours a week from your manager but you give them back 20 you are worth more than somebody who takes 2 hours from them and only gives them back 3 hours you either create a positive or A negative Roi for your manager and for the whole company people who get promoted are not only the ones who reduce the amount of effort and friction their boss is putting towards a certain function they also look for opportunities to reduce friction in all ways for all people in the entire company even if it's not within their job description but they are people who seek out other ways that they can reduce friction they're constantly pulling things from their boss they're looking at what their boss is doing and thinking how can I grab something from them one of the tips that I give people all the time when they're trying to get promoted is I say you know what you should do go look at your manager's calendar and I just want you to go ask if you could take something off when I was in the process of selling my company and I had a COO in place one of the tips I gave her and something that we put into place was that every week I asked her before the week started to look at my calendar and tell me what she could take from me and this was probably the best practice that we could have had because one it was a very positive experience for me because I was like wow this is amazing you can take all the stuff on my plate two she was elevating herself in learning by that process and then what we had time to do because she would let me know the things is then we could sink ahead of time time and I could walk her through some of those things so what's happening is that she might take 6 hours of things off of my calendar and it might just take a 15minute touch base with me so I could debrief her on those things so then she could take those 6 hours away and so if you're trying to get promoted one of the best things you could do is constantly calendar grab calendar grabbing is where you're like grabbing up at all the items on your manager's calendar and seeing what you can take on your plate and so by doing that not only do you reduce friction you also create a higher Roi for your manager and so if you're sitting here wondering I wonder if I add or create friction simply ask your manager these questions okay one do I make your life easier or harder it's a real question I can tell you right now there are some people who I'd have to think about it whereas there's some people where it's like a complete no-brainer you're like totally make my life easier it's a home run like they're a complete positive Roi the next question that you could ask is how hard would you fight to keep me meaning if you said I'm out and I want to leave tomorrow how hard would you fight to keep me here those two questions will tell you are you in the negative are you in the positive are you reducing friction or are you creating friction and so if you're not aware of where you sit with your manager those are the two questions that I would use to ask that person to have a real conversation so you can actually calibrate where you're at and if you're recognizing and listening to this right now and thinking you know what I actually don't take much off of my manager plate I don't take much and I think that though I reduce friction by having my job I'm not like constantly pulling things my suggestion is go go look right now at what they have on their calendar next week find at least one thing you can take off and then for the first time ask them permission can I take this off your plate here's the thing just because it's not your job doesn't mean it can't be your responsibility and the best leaders in the company guys they don't look at themselves as the leader of marketing the leader of sales the leader of customer success they look at themselves as a leader in the company and they take everything personally and they recognize that not every fits perfectly into a job description and they're okay with that and they're willing to take things on when they have the time and they have the skills to do so and the best leaders look at themselves as advocates of the company rather than leaders of a function

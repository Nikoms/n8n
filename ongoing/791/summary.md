### Switching from Executing to Advocating
Many employees believe that working harder and executing better is the path to promotion. However, executing alone is not enough. The real key to getting promoted is learning to advocate for yourself. This means clearly communicating your accomplishments, ideas, and future plans to your boss regularly. For example, a CFO who consistently shared detailed weekly reports and updates on her work was noticed and promoted faster than an equally skilled executor who did not communicate as well.

The important insight here is that if no one knows about the work you do, it might as well not exist in their perception. Advocacy and communication are leadership skills that differentiate top performers from those who stay stuck in their current roles. As the speaker says, "More of the same keeps you stuck where you are."

### Operating in the Now Plus Tomorrow
Great leaders go beyond reacting to daily demands and start thinking strategically about the future. One example from the speaker's company contrasted a financial leader who built a thorough vision and hiring plan with a systems leader who was only focused on executing present tasks. The difference was the proactive versus reactive mindset.

To grow in your role, you must pull the future into the present by anticipating challenges and opportunities, creating vision documents, and planning ahead. Being stuck in an "execution spiral"—constantly putting out fires without enough time for strategic thinking—can lead to burnout and limit growth. The speaker encourages regularly blocking time to think and plan: "The best leaders schedule their priorities rather than fitting priorities into their schedule."

### Mastering Time Management Before Managing Yourself and Others
Before leading others effectively, learn to manage your own time and commitments strategically. The speaker shares a story about an HR leader who didn’t manage her time well, resulting in erratic moods and poor leadership presence. Managing your time means prioritizing the right tasks and being flexible to adjust your focus daily.

Managing time is foundational to managing yourself and ultimately others. The speaker reminds us that everyone has the same 24 hours a day and managing those hours effectively is what distinguishes leaders. "Your schedule is a reflection of your priorities," and leaders are those who ruthlessly prioritize to ensure growth and success.

### Be a Lubricator, Not a Stopper: Removing Friction
Leaders get promoted by reducing friction—the obstacles that slow down workflows or burden their managers. If you take significant time from your manager but return minimal value, you're creating friction. Conversely, employees who lighten their managers' loads by taking on appropriate tasks provide a positive ROI and stand out.

One practical tip is to review your manager’s calendar and ask if you can take some meetings or responsibilities off their plate. This shows initiative and creates capacity for your manager and yourself to focus on higher-value work.

Leaders aren’t just advocates for their function but for the entire company. They willingly take responsibility beyond their job descriptions to reduce friction and move the organization forward.

### Conclusion
Getting promoted is less about working longer or mastering more technical skills and more about developing communication, strategic thinking, time management, and leadership skills. Advocating for your work, thinking proactively about the future, managing time effectively, and reducing friction are key habits that differentiate future leaders.

As the speaker emphasizes, "Trade doing more for talking more," and focus your discretionary effort on building executive presence by communicating clearly, planning ahead, and lifting others up. Progress in leadership comes from consistent practice and the courage to advocate, plan, and take responsibility beyond your job description.

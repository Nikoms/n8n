This video features a valuable insight unclosed within the "magic loop", a credible process for leveling up your career: 

1. Do your job well.
2. Ask your manager how you can support them.
3. Complete what your manager asks of you.
4. Discuss your career goals and align tasks to those objectives. 
5. Repeat the process consistently to establish a trust-based partnership with your manager. 

Another spotlight from the dialogue is the innovative concept of inventiveness; it's not always about creating something completely new but rather a blend of existing ideas to introduce an inventive product or solution. When discussing your achievements, bring the focus to the impact they had on the business, rather than merely stating how hard you worked.

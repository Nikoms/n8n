I want to share this video with you about Ethan Evans, a former Amazon VP, discussing several key aspects of career growth. He presents an intriguing five-step process to level up your career: firstly, meeting your manager's expectations; then asking your manager how you can assist; following that, carrying out tasks your manager requests; discussing your goals; and finally, repeating the loop. 

What struck me most is Evans' assertion that 'invention' is about uniting two existing ideas, not necessarily creating something entirely new. In job prospects and interviews, he suggests that it's more compelling to highlight your impact on the business rather than the hard work you put in. 

He also suggests actionable steps to take when you've messed up, involving acknowledging the mistake, proactively communicating, seeking support to resolve the issue, and persistently weathering any doubts about your capabilities.

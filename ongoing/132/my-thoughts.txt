In this profound video, former Amazon VP Ethan Evans shares a straightforward yet effective five-step process or 'magic loop' for career growth:

1. Excel at your current role.
2. Probe your boss on how you can provide further assistance.
3. Execute tasks assigned by your boss, even those that seem menial; it fosters trust.
4. Discuss your career aspirations with your boss and try to align your tasks to these goals.
5. Repeat the process, thereby consolidating your relationship with your boss.

Evans also shared a unique perspective on innovation. He argues that creativity isn't necessarily about inventing something entirely new but more about fusing two unrelated ideas to spawn something completely unprecedented. This viewpoint obviously struck a chord with me. I found this video truly informative and think it could offer valuable insights to you as well.

To get promoted faster, you must first reliably perform at your current level and maintain a strong, supportive relationship with your manager, as they play a crucial role in advocating for your promotion. Choose projects that align closely with your companyâ€™s current business needs and priorities, rather than just what seems technically impressive, to maximize your impact. Balancing next-level responsibilities with your existing duties is essential to avoid getting middling performance reviews despite high-profile contributions.

### Tech Industry Layoffs and Career Implications

In 2023, the tech industry laid off 250,000 employees, and as of early 2024, another 50,000 tech workers have been laid off. The pattern indicates that low performers and junior-level staff are typically the first to lose their jobs. With the rapid advancement of AI and an emphasis on hiring senior employees only, the role of a senior engineer has effectively become the new junior engineer position. For junior and mid-level engineers, advancing to senior status quickly is now the best safeguard in these uncertain times.

### The Critical Role of Manager Relationships in Promotions

Author Steve Winn shares his personal promotion journey to illustrate the profound impact managers have on career growth. His experience with "Bob," an unsupportive and incompetent manager, delayed his promotion by over two years costing him potential millions in earnings. Conversely, his relationship with "Carl," a technically skilled and caring manager, significantly accelerated his promotion once Carl advocated on his behalf.

> "The relationship with your manager is the most important one you'll have at work and definitely the most important for your next promotion."

If you have a poor relationship with your manager or find them incompetent, the advice is clear: either repair the relationship, move to a different team with a better manager, or find a new job. Clinging to a bad manager will delay promotions and cost you financially and professionally.

### Choosing Promotion-Worthy Projects Based on Company Needs

Promotion projects should not only sound impactful but must align closely with the company's current priorities and values. Winn presents hypothetical scenarios contrasting high-effort, strategic projects versus simpler, aligned tasks:

- Automating tests might be valuable if manual testing significantly burdens the team; otherwise, adding more manual tests could be equally impactful.
- Building scalable architectures is beneficial if feature development is slow, but critical new features might require immediate attention.
- Efforts to save money on infrastructure only make sense if the potential savings significantly outweigh the time and resources spent.

> "You want to develop a nose for impact based on what your company values and what they need."

Understanding these nuances helps avoid misallocating effort on projects that don't boost your promotion prospects.

### Balancing Current Responsibilities with Next-Level Projects

When aiming for promotions beyond senior engineer, cross-functional projects involving multiple teams become common. However, putting all your effort into these next-level projects while neglecting your current duties can backfire.

> "You need to meet and maintain expectations at your current level before you attempt to take on scope at the next level."

The right approach is to allocate approximately 75% of your capacity to advanced projects, keeping enough bandwidth to consistently perform your current responsibilities well. Skipping foundational duties leads to poor performance reviews and stalled promotions, even if the advanced work is successful.

### Final Thoughts

The promotion journey is complex and influenced by relationships, project choice, and balancing roles. Steve Winn emphasizes accelerating promotion prospects by:

- Building strong, supportive relationships with managers.
- Selecting projects aligned with business needs.
- Maintaining high performance at the current level while taking on higher-level work.

Making software well requires more than just addressing immediate bugs or adding features—it demands continuous attention to the underlying technical debt caused by neglect. The video highlights that unmanaged technical debt stems from what hasn’t been done or noticed, rather than just visible errors, so focusing on preventing issues at their root (stopping water from coming into the boat) is crucial. Maintaining code quality is an ongoing process, akin to housework: regular, incremental care avoids overwhelming backlogs and costly surprises. Ultimately, software is a long-term product, not a project with a clear end, so maintaining its structure and knowledge over time is key to sustainable success.

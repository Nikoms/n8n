The video emphasizes that C-style for loops using array.length are the fastest iteration method because they avoid the overhead of iterators and function calls. It also highlights the importance of CPU cache efficiency by accessing data sequentially in memory to minimize costly cache misses and improve performance. Additionally, using coroutines with yield can help spread heavy computations over multiple frames, preventing event loop blocking and keeping the UI responsive.

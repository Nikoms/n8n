The video emphasizes that C-style for loops provide the best performance compared to higher-level iterators like forEach or map, due to lower overhead in iteration. It also highlights the importance of cache coherency in loopsâ€”accessing data sequentially in memory significantly boosts speed by leveraging CPU cache lines and avoiding costly memory fetches. Both points illustrate practical ways to write JavaScript loops that maximize CPU efficiency.

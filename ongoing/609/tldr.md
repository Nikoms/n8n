- The 9th fallacy of distributed computing is that versioning is simple.
- Even basic microservices ecosystems involve multiple artifacts requiring versioning: API endpoints, contracts (e.g., JSON or XML schemas), services, and shared libraries.
- Managing versions across these artifacts can become extremely complex and confusing.
- Example given is a trading app posting buy orders for stock, where the representation of a stock (Apple) can vary (symbol, QSIP, SEDOL).
- Changing contract versions without proper versioning breaks clients relying on the old versions.
- Versioning the API endpoints alone creates duplication; a better approach is versioning at the contract level using request headers and vendor MIME types.
- Implementing versioning logic in services adds complexity, such as conditional handling of different contract versions.
- Supporting multiple versions eventually becomes unsustainable as older versions may be deprecated.
- Communication about version changes and deprecations across teams adds layers of complexity beyond technical challenges.
- Versioning requires careful governance, communication, and strategyâ€”it's not as simple as it seems.

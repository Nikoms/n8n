When to rewrite?

- Rewrite when it delivers new user value or addresses critical platform issues that prevent progress.
- Prefer incremental rewrites, gradually replacing old components while maintaining functionality, following the "strangling tree" patternâ€”slowly phasing out legacy code by building around and then replacing it.
- Avoid rewrites that halt feature delivery or create an all-or-nothing situation, as this risks losing market share to competitors.
- Sometimes creating a new product or competing internally (as with Adobe Flash or VS Code examples) is a successful rewrite strategy.

Our highest priority is to satisfy the customer through early and continuous delivery of valuable software.

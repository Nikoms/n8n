When to rewrite?

- Rewrites should focus on delivering customer value early and continuously, as per the Agile manifesto's highest priority.
- Itâ€™s important to approach rewrites incrementally, replacing parts of the system step-by-step rather than all at once.
- The strangling tree pattern is a useful strategy here: gradually growing new, improved parts around the old system until the legacy code can be fully replaced.
- Doing rewrites without delivering value during the process risks losing market share and getting shut down, so always align rewrites with feature delivery or critical platform transitions.

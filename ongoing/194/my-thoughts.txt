When to rewrite? Focus on these two key points:

- A rewrite should deliver clear user value throughout the process, not just at the end.
- Incremental delivery is crucialâ€”rewrite in small, manageable steps that allow continuous improvement and avoid an all-or-nothing risk.

The strangling tree pattern is a useful approach here: gradually replace parts of the old system while keeping it running until the new system fully takes over.

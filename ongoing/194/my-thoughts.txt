When to rewrite code? The video highlights two main points: first, a rewrite should deliver clear user or business value, not just be done for its own sake. Second, rewrites need to be incremental, allowing continued delivery of value throughout the process rather than all at once. Approaching rewrites as feature implementations or as phased replacements ensures minimizing risk and maintaining competitiveness.

When to rewrite? The video points to two main reasons: first, rewrites should deliver user value throughout the process, not just after completion; second, rewrites need to be incremental, allowing parts of the new system to replace the old while still functioning. Rewriting without ongoing value delivery or trying to do an all-or-nothing rewrite risks losing market share and stalling progress. The video also highlights strategies like creating a new product for a different market or gradually replacing backend components as effective approaches to avoid the common pitfalls of rewrites.

- Continuous Delivery (CD) enables fast, secure, reliable production changes focusing mainly on applications.
- Applications should have clear, backward/forward compatible public interfaces with versioning and deprecation strategies.
- Disposability is key: applications must support rolling redeployments, handle shutdown gracefully, and start quickly.
- Stateless design is essential to avoid session affinity and enable easy scaling and deployment.
- Delivery units (encapsulation) should contain all code, tests, monitoring, alerts, and configuration in a single versioned repository.
- Testing should rely heavily on stubbed functional tests in realistic environments with real backing services and stubbed dependencies.
- Observability (metrics, logs, dashboards, alerts) must be versioned and deployed with the application.
- Minimize configuration and keep it environment-specific; treat database schema as versioned code tightly coupled with the application.
- Design for mixed-version running and reduced blast radius across regions.
- Decouple application architecture from infrastructure to enable portability across cloud providers and platforms.
- Emphasize automated health checks (liveness/readiness), graceful shutdown, and fast startup to ensure reliability during deployments.
- The talk references the 12 Factor App principles as foundational guidance.

in this video I'll give you a number of tips on how to best answer interview questions um in job interviews with Amazon of course I'm going to be focusing on behavioral type of questions and I'm going to you know try to do a better job than CH GPT uh as I'm seeing more and more of you are enjoying using it nowadays okay number one how do you show customer Obsession I might tell you right from the start that this is harder than many of you expect to answer because there's a discrepancy uh between standards of different candidates and this is actually so efficient that uh many other high performing companies have also embedded this customer Obsession in their core values or leadership principles right so um to give you a number of counter examples to examplify what I'm saying here a developer talks about how they fixed a critical production bug on short notice you know as if they made their customer a favor for doing so right so this is not customer obession right or I have instances where people talked about or Bankers talked about how they literally Corner the customer into the best possible deal for them all right so this is again a bit Shady or I also had an example of an executive um bragging about how they hurried up selling a business unit for being afraid of getting sued due to some shady business dealings not under their command of course right so needless to say customer obsession is when you literally go above and beyond for the customers for the right reasons as well right uh the second question I like to talk about here is the time it got stuck 75% through a project and how did you answer it got done and was it a successful one right so um to answer this question in the best possible way you must think about what is challenging in your specific role for your specific job disc description and can you think of a time when your strength helped you to overcome difficulties and eventually get the job done right could be a project but could be some other type of initiative as well right for different types of roles if you're thinking about the leadership principle here this is deliver results right and notice I'm trying to help you here was it a successful one uh because what happens here is many candidates uh choose to shoot themselves in the food by talking an success or slightly successful type of initiative right where the question clearly asks you a time and you got stuck 75% or a project in a job interview sell yourself as a successful candidate right most of the time unless you know what you're doing which is you know some people who are really really skilled at interviewing and could sell themselves on failures um then you should talk about a successful project which you successfully completed ultimately right deliver results being the leader ERS ship uh principle in question right so don't shoot yourself in the food just talk about a successful one right and think about what's challenging for your specific role if you want to have the best possible answer to these types of questions uh number three here tell me about the time and you failed right now um I'll just start by saying that uh you should not talk about a failure which will put your ation in danger such as how you got fired from your lust for a critical mistake two months ago right this is the typ of fail you wouldn't want or you You' be skeptical uh putting forward especially in a job interview of course unless you know what you're doing right but more interestingly maybe for many of you would be uh a couple a couple of scenarios where um uh a failure story would make the most sense so why would someone ask you for failure story um they could do it because uh people um who don't prepare job interviews in advance will have a harder time answering failure uh questions in an efficient way so they they would use it in a way to gouge uh if you prepared your interview at all right this would be the first thing um the second thing would be to see if you can sell yourself on this story because it's perfectly possible and I even encourage you to sell yourself yourself with every possible answer in the job interview and the way You' sell yourself on a failure study would be through its learnings okay so half of your answer should be your learnings and uh I must warn you that uh if you find it difficult to find the number of failures you feel comfortable talking about and finding its learnings will take at least as much time as it took you to come up with a failure story in the first place right so long story short learning should be half of your answer and don't shoot yourself in the in the foot you L to say here um and also um the third scenario what someone would ask you this is because some people prefer to um have a tendency to never ever agree they failed right I I don't fail I only learn and some people would even further especially the ones who don't prepare interviews uh would tend to go on the general side and would refuse allog together to talk about them they actually failed they would they they talk about how they would fail right or um you know this is also another interviewing technique if you want or fake fake it until you make it type of approach like don't answer the question but try to get around the corner and talk about the project which was not so successful but indeed it was actually they want to dive deeper into it it's your choice right is just that I'm talking in the context of interviewing with high performing companies who really know what they expect from the best candidates right so I'm trying to advise you on how to give the best possible answers here number four tell me about the time and you how to deal with an ambiguous situation such as when you didn't have enough data to make the right decision how did you approach the situation what was the outcome right so needless to say You' want to talk about a success story here right and if you're wondering wealth leip principle is in question uh this would be our right a lot okay so first things first what is ambiguity in your role how do you Define ambiguity for your role because there's different levels at which you can speak about ambiguity depending on the type of role you're into you know obviously an executive uh would regard ambiguous situations differently than a DBA admin if you want okay so for example a DBA admin could be predicting latency of a new config under some data intensive scenario right and uh basically the best answers in such a scenario you know I'm I'm giving you here would be when you use previous experience to determine the best course of action or when you ask for additional advice to remove some ambiguity or to bring in Clarity even or you simply recognize you need additional info to make the right call I don't know maybe you attended some courses to uh to arrive to the best possible to eliminate this type of ambiguity right but this would be the the three scenarios uh three elements which would greatly significantly improve the quality of your answers on how how would you deal with ambiguity such as when you didn't have the right data to make the right decision right so you um you could uh basically use your previous experience previous similar experience or ask someone else around this or educate yourself on the specific needs of this project right number five here tell me about the time you convinced someone of something right um so how do you convince someone of something okay you focus on gaining their trust okay so it's a trust issue most of the time okay and uh if this sounds easy to you then in my experience it's quite easy to even unintentionally uh put the blame on someone else or even on the company that you previously worked for or you say it's simply bad luck okay so or even worse I've had people to publicly humiliate or criticized others in this context right so time going have to convince someone of something is a question how do you build trust there right so um again the examples the the the the context of this question is around uh around assessing your interpersonal skills it's a earned trust as a leadership principle if you want but what you want to focus on here is the keyword trust how do you build trust with stakeholders in a in an initiative if you want right number six tell me about the time you had a major disagreement with your boss right so it's the same type of question in the sense that you still want to focus on trust and now it's a slightly different leadership principle have backbone disagree and commit so um what you want to do here is to basically have two Avenues first on how you find the proof you know maybe you found some data to make your point to convince them that hey yes um the disagreement and you are right using the data and the second part of this would be to uh communicate this in an efficient way you know with the goal to establish trust right so whereas in the first in the previous question time when you convince someone something is trust is the Central and the main thing you would want to do this and could also embed this one time had a disagreement with your boss uh now this disagreement with your boss is on a slightly different principle but the the key thing is the same right and as I said previously you don't want to put the blame on someone right and even further for the purpose of have backbone disagreeing commit you don't want to come across as argumentative uh which uh in my experience people who come across this argument that they are also the most likely who did not prepare their job interview or who simply cannot get over some sort of previous experience that they find it like it was super damaging the way they felt and simply could not get over it right so if you have examples that you're not really confident you can talk about in a job interview um you know I don't know as someone else or try to role play with someone but if you still feel not confident about it then find something else you know um a job interview is about confidence as well like most confident candidates also more significantly more likely to bias the interviews towards them right if you speak convincingly or if you put together a great show for um an example here right uh number seven why Amazon okay so um what I would want to highlight here is that the vast majority of candidates answer this question of why Amazon by praising the company over and over and over again and talking again about the leadership principles they connect the best with and the amazing people they are going to work with and the amazing company with an amazing growth trajectory with an amazing stock market uh performance this year at least and and so on um what many of you um what many of you could greatly benefit from when answering these type of questions to really think what's in for you as well and say sell yourself on that uh during uh during this interview because um this will also exhibit a bit of commercialism in on your side that you you really you're not there just to execute whatever you they'll ask you to do but you'd also you know show a bit of a backbone of what's in for you um now to get this to the extreme of course you're also going there for the money of course now um you could say it as well I don't think they if you feel that that's appropriate but I believe if you spend a bit of time for the right reasons to prepare an answer to this interview question of why Amazon I think you'll you'll come to the conclusion that you can find out uh many more interesting reasons of what's in for you if uh you get higher there and you know in in a bit to make your answer to different to make your answers to differentiate yourself from other candidates right because it's the memorable type of answers for the good reasons of course which um make or break the the show there right um so long story short why Amazon still gets asked right I won't talk about the elevator pitch in this video but on why Amazon still get S and I believe it's worthwhile investing a bit of time there of thinking what's in for you and what can you share from that perspective with your interviewer right number eight here a time when set a vision when there wasn't one okay so if you're thinking about what leadership principle is this one this would be on think big right so a vision when there wasn't one um here you know to give you a quick example from my own experience um it was maybe around a year ago when chbt uh became more mainstream and I also started integrating into my training programs and I allowed uh candidates to generate examples using chbt for examples to interview questions for your own specific role and I noticed you know there's really interest in using these features you know it's I call them pleasure features and I thought what would be the best way to further integrate with such features to also you know um draw some results to uh to to make it to draw some more interesting benefits from this and what I came to realize is that um instead of U rewarding you with answers for interview questions for your own role I could reward you for writing your stories by implementing a feature to evaluate your stories right so this was the vision I had and I believe it's uh quite successful actually I'm pretty convinced it's quite successful and since I have many many people adding thousands thousand of stories and using those features using generative AI to evaluate your answers specifically on Amazon's leadership principles as well and uh this brings value and this significantly increases the quality of your story Banks and um overall I think it's it's been quite uh successful right so this is an example of a vision now what is a successful vision for your own role uh focus on results like notice in my example uh my goal was to increase engagement in my training programs and um if before I had hundreds of stories and literally I had to fight with candidates to give me their stories now the candidates feel like it's a beneficial tradeoff to give me their stories in return for using those features to evaluate them right number nine a time when you jumped on something outside of your area of responsibility but definitely your company's best interest okay so um this is on the leadership principle of ownership right so take ownership um and here I thought of exemplifying this with a with maybe an exaggeration on a personal level so um have you ever saved someone from drowning okay so this U this is the type of experience you know if you wanted to correlate a little bit um to business and leadership in general like again it's an exaggeration but this is you'd want to highlight your ownership not getting done something because of the sake of um being done something memorable ideally you know this was uh my point here number 10 ATT time on speed was of essence okay and the leadership principal involved here was be biased for action and maybe the most classic example would be when having to estimate a time frame for a project to finalize a bid yet still some requirements not being crystal clear right still time is of essence and you have to deliver on that uh estimation so the bid can move forward right instead of um focusing on on the accuracy of those details and what's key here if you want is that decision is that timeline you give there is a reversible one so many times Pro projects go over time and over budget uh for the right reason because it's impossible to estimate them it wasn't key to estimate them accurately in the first place so if you want to think about uh how do you showcase speed in decision making you talk about reversible decisions in particular right the decision was reversible then it means speed could have been core in that scenario right number 11 what is your most recent invention okay so um the leadership principle I believe is obvious but and I believe this is an easy question to answer for most candidates however um can you make your answer memorable an answer that they could remember after a week after a month or after a year ideally right so for example I had a candidate who talked about how they Implement an AI system to spot potholes uh using cameras mounted on garbage trucks okay it's something that's memorable or a patent pending algorithm to achieve something you know these are the type of experience which which are memorable and I believe this is how you score the best points for this particular scenario of an invention right number 12 how do you learn Okay so um how do you learn in HR there's a there's a well-known trick that you must showcase how you exhibit curiosi in learning by using multiple sources right so you don't just uh take your information from one channel but rather use a broader range of sources what's also important what's also key here in the way you learn is um uh Concepts such as Forward Thinking or experimentation you know um basically want to stay away from um from um famili familiarity if you want or from famili familiar approaches right or just being that old fashion type of person who thinks backwards in a way right so this is how you exhibit you know that type of a little bit of curiosity and forward thinking and that typ of experimentation if you want right this would be the key here and finally what's your weakness number 13 okay so the dumbest weakness weakness I I've ever heard would be interviewing skills like I don't interview well as if this was the core for the role you were applying for right um now a slightly better one would be public speaking you know which is over a decade old and still widely used widely used in uh in job indivis today uh just not for high paying jobs you know I mean I it's it's simply out of fashion these These Days uh now what's interesting for answering this interview question what's your weakness could be um something from the job description something that's usually the elephant in the room right so if you have something that you clearly don't have experience with and they know you don't have experience with you could address that when answering the weakness question in a way that in a in the in a bid that you can sell yourself on that by addressing by this concept of addressing the elephant in the room and actually I've had great success this with level seven type of rols with addressing this elephant in the room because on the thinking that if you prepare this in advance then you could as well sell yourself on it and I won't get into details you know because this video will get too long but uh the weakness question if it gets asked you still have to sell yourself on it and the more interesting the more memorable the more likely you are to buy uh the the interviewer towards you and this is what uh makes uh this is what delivers job offers in uh today's market so hopefully you found this interesting and thank you very much for watching

From the video and my personal perspective, the key takeaways are the three significant lessons:

- Approach interviewing like a game of professional poker - it's a numbers challenge where you can't always expect to win, but lining up multiple opportunities reduces the risk and increases your chances.
- Understand that interviews don't necessarily mirror your day-to-day skill set - they're designed more to filter out those who aren't a good fit, rather than assessing your practical abilities.
- Don't neglect the importance of your behavioural traits in an interview - showing you're able to learn quickly, work as a team, and have a positive attitude often carries as much weight as your technical skills.  

These lessons serve as a practical guide to navigate your career movement more smoothly. Keep these in mind - they could be game changers in your job hunt strategy.

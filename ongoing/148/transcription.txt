I started at Amazon in 2006 as a support engineer a person responsible for keeping the website up and running it's an important job but sometimes when everything was broken it felt like I was a digital janitor constantly cleaning up other people's messes I had to carry a pager it was not uncommon to be paged more than 100 times in a week whenever I was paged I had to stop whatever I was doing and log on to see what the issue was there was no end to it it happened day and night usually carrying the pager is spread across all of the members of your team however when I arrived at Amazon several people were leaving as a result for many months I was the only one carrying the pager this difficult period in my life turned out to be a turning point as it motivated me to take action as Tony Robbins said change happens when the pain of staying the same is greater than the pain of change I knew that I didn't want to be a support engineer for the rest of my life even if my on-call shifts got better I wanted to be a software developer write code and build systems so I went all in on preparing for the technical interview to become a software developer while Ally had a heavy on-call load now I'm in L7 principal software engineer I've also conducted 850 technical interviews I'm a bar raiser and I've trained over a thousand people at Amazon how to conduct interviews and I finally know why I was successful back then in this video I'll share with you three big lessons I learned while I was digging myself out of that hole so you don't have to go through the heartache I did this is my free gift from Uncle Steve to you all I ask is that if you find my content useful you subscribe to my channel and email newsletter where I help Tech professionals level up in their careers there's a link in the description the first lesson is a mental block that people have when they're interviewing and it holds them back and makes them feel bad about themselves unnecessarily preparing for interviews is emotionally and physically draining so you want to minimize the time it takes to get an acceptable offer if you don't learn this lesson you'll drag things out longer than you have to I see it all the time in people that I talk with and I don't understand how it got into their heads it can ruin their chances of getting a different job and it also kills their self-esteem and that lesson is that interviewing is a number numbers game when I was younger I wanted to become a professional poker player and if ever there was a numbers game it's professional poker and the sick part about it is that you can have the best hand two Aces and still lose that hand and you can have the worst hand a 2-7 offsuit and still win you make money in poker over time by making good decisions hand after hand and so with interviewing you should not expect to win every time even if you have prepared everything perfectly when I was finally ready to do software developer interviews I didn't do just one interview I lined up four interviews looking back at it I probably should have lined up 10. I ended up receiving three offers from those four which allowed me to be selective if I had spent all that time targeting just one team could have been the team that passed on me I would have felt terrible and it might have discouraged me at the very least it would have prolonged the time it took to actually receive an offer if you know anything about recruiting it's that they operate on their own schedule at some companies they're fast and efficient at some companies they aren't so fast and efficient you want to start the process with many companies in parallel not serially when you're interviewing don't become emotionally invested in a single opportunity there are too many external factors that you can't control you could encounter an inexperienced interviewer who had a bad day or stepped in dog poop right before your interview they might ask you the one question you wanted to prepare for but couldn't get to perhaps they already interviewed a superstar earlier that week and the position is already filled when interviewing segment accompanies you're interested in into a tier list with proper preparation you should expect at least one offer from your top tier use the companies in the lower tier as practice to reduce nervousness in subsequent interviews plus who knows maybe a lower tier company will surprise you by practicing with these companies good things are more likely to happen the second lesson I learned is a common complaint that I've heard from many people and it holds them back because they think the world shouldn't be this way they prepare the way they think they things should be instead of the way that things actually are it's a common trap that I've also fallen into during a question I went off on a tangent and it led me to not receiving an offer that lesson is that inner interviews are not intended to test your day-to-day job skills instead the purpose is to ensure that companies never hire a bad candidate even if that means filtering out people who would otherwise perform well in that job the Gatehouse does not resemble the clubhouse the skills that make you successful at work are not the same as those that make you successful at interviewing there are two types of Poker limit and no limit in limit games the number of chips you can put into the pot is capped while in No Limit games the amount you can bet is not capped even though the rules are otherwise exactly the same these games could not be more different during a system design interview I was once asked to design a system that I had actually built in real life I was thrilled to receive that question and I could hardly contain my excitement I had filed patents in this area and I was intimately familiar with how to actually build these systems in real life I could talk about it forever but where I took the question was not the same place as the interviewer wanted to go and so I bombed that question that I should have crushed because I thought the interviewer wanted to talk about what it actually took to build one of these systems and production when actually he wanted to talk about something else I've seen it on both sides of the table when I ask a system design question I'm not actually asking you to design a system that takes weeks or months I'm trying to have an interesting conversation about some of the topics I want to talk about to size you up companies don't give you real world work during interviews because it takes longer than the hour they have to evaluate you instead they ask proxy questions to minimize false positives it can be frustrating to be filtered out because the interviewer wanted to talk about some arbitrary thing even though you may be a good fit for the job however it's best not to take it personally and recognize that it's a numbers game companies are optimizing for minimal false positives so when you go into an interview you need to make sure to listen to what the interviewer is saying and let them guide you through their questioning if you play a No Limit game like a limit game you're gonna get destroyed don't get caught playing the wrong game because you think the world should be a different way before we continue I'd like to drop a quick note for today's sponsor brilliant.org just like the best way to prepare for a coding interview is by doing coding problems if you you're trying to learn math science or computer science the best way to do so interactively is with brilliant reading or passively watching YouTube videos is probably the worst way to learn something not only does the information not stick it gives you a false sense that you understand things deeply when you don't with Brilliance interactive courses you can learn the key Concepts and practice your skills in the same place brilliant has lessons on everything with new ones added every month from probability to machine learning there is so much content on brilliant I really value continuing education if I

noticed this phenomenon frequently in the past couple of years with the rise of Lee code and the tech interview prep industry it's a form of Target fixation that can lead to down leveling or Worse not getting an offer even if you've answered all of the questions perfectly and that lesson is only focusing on the technical portion of the interview in poker if you only look at your hand and don't take anything else into consideration you're only seeing part of the picture to be successful it's important to consider your position the number of trips you have as well as the number of trips the other players have and how they're behaving yes you should get good at Lee code and system design questions but the technical portion of the interview is the ante is it necessary but not sufficient condition to get the offer the behavioral portion of a job interview is critical to actually Landing the job this is where interviewers ask about your prior experience you want to make sure you tell good stories that communicate your high performance seniority and relevant experience and avoid raising red flags such as giving them the impression that you're difficult to work with it can also be the difference when you have a lukewarm performance during the technical portion of the interview if you have three technical interviews one bombed one's really good and one was just okay the conversation is going to shift to the behavioral portion of the interview you have a good showing there you may be able to salvage an offer when I was interviewing for sde positions I didn't crush the technical portions I did okay I did make sure though that the answers to the soft questions demonstrated that I was a fast learner thorough with my work a good co-worker and hungry for more and I think that was the critical difference to getting all of those offers of course none of this matters if you don't do decently well in the technical portion of the interview but it doesn't take too much effort to make sure you have good answers to behavioral questions so don't neglect them because they aren't technical if you want to know how to answer these questions effectively and avoid getting down leveled I break it down step by step in this video if you got the job and want to know what to do next take a look at this video where I break down what new software developers should focus on either way work hard and don't let your uncle Steve down foreign

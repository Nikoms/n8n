- Software has two key values: what it does (functionality) and its structure.
- Programmers often focus only on functionality and meeting current requirements.
- The structure, or flexibility to change, is arguably more valuable.
- Software must be changeable because requirements evolve; otherwise, it becomes worthless.
- Low cost of modification is crucial for ongoing adaptability.
- Maximizing functionality today at the expense of flexibility can lead to project failure.
- Good software balances working functionality with a well-designed, adaptable structure.

The video argues that while code reviews are important, pull requests often introduce delays that undermine continuous integration by slowing feedback cycles. Pair programming integrates code review within development itself, enabling faster, higher-quality outcomes without the bottlenecks of asynchronous reviews. This approach supports continuous integration and delivery by providing immediate feedback, increasing productivity, and reducing defects, making it a more efficient alternative to traditional code reviews. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27295641_The_Case_for_Collaborative_Programming

The video highlights that traditional pull requests can slow down continuous integration by creating delays in code review and feedback cycles. Instead, it advocates for integrating code review directly into development through pair programming, which provides immediate, continuous feedback and improves both speed and quality. This approach aligns with research showing that collaborative programming is more efficient and produces fewer defects compared to asynchronous code reviews.

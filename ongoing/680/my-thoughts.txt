The video explains that while code reviews are important, pull requests often slow down the feedback loop essential for effective continuous integration and continuous delivery. Instead, it advocates for pair programming as an integrated, real-time code review that maintains fast, high-quality feedback without the delays caused by asynchronous pull requests. This approach supports the data-backed need for frequent integration and avoids the inefficiencies and frustrations commonly associated with pull request reviews. https://www.researchgate.net/publication/27295641_The_Case_for_Collaborative_Programming

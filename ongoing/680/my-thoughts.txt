The video explains that pair programming is the most efficient way to integrate code review into the development process, providing continuous feedback without slowing down progress. Unlike pull requests, which can delay continuous integration due to asynchronous and often slow reviews, pair programming offers immediate two-way communication and enables developers to commit small, verified changes frequently. While some people may initially resist pair programming, evidence shows pairs produce higher quality work faster than individuals working alone.

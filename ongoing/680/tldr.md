- Software is complicated and requires cautious, careful development.
- Continuous Integration (CI) with trunk-based development improves quality and speed based on large-scale data.
- Pull requests often hinder fast feedback necessary for effective CI.
- Code reviews are important but pull requests slow down the process due to waiting times and asynchronous communication.
- Pair programming integrates code review into the development process, providing fast, high-quality feedback.
- Pair programming improves productivity and reduces defects despite common misconceptions.
- Teams should experiment with pair programming for a short period to evaluate its benefits.

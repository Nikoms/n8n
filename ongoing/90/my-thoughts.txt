In this engaging video, Ethan Evans (Amazon) strongly advocates for taking control of your career. Rather than simply outlining what you've done, he emphasizes the importance of highlighting the impact of those actions. It's a relevant point that I can attest to; understanding your value goes beyond the tasks, it's about the significance and influence of your efforts. Definitely, a video worth sharing!

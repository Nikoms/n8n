- Use skills for automatic, repeatable workflows where you want a modular, dedicated solution that can compose multiple sub agents, slash commands, and MCP servers.  
- Use sub agents when you need isolated context windows and want to parallelize tasks, especially for scalable, isolated workflows that don’t require context persistence.  
- Use custom slash commands for manual triggers and simple, one-off prompt tasks; they are the fundamental compositional unit and should be your starting point.  
- Use MCP servers to connect your agents to external data sources and third-party services, or to bundle multiple external integrations under one interface.

## My thoughts

Starting your career interviews at your dream companies might not be ideal, honing your skills further by practicing with other firms first could provide a richer experience. This additional practice can lead to better performance when the time comes to interview at the companies you are most interested in.

## TLDR;
- Tech interviews are broken but consistent in their flaws.
- There are three types of interview questions: coding, system design, and behavioral, each with surface meaning and deeper intent.
- Coding questions test problem-solving and reasoning, not just knowledge of answers.
- Being receptive to hints and thinking out loud is critical during interviews.
- Maximizing performance requires comfort, calmness, good physical preparation, and reducing anxiety.
- Practice interviews with lower-stakes companies before targeting dream jobs to improve skills.
- Organize and track your interview prep and applications using tools like monday.com.
- System design interviews focus on meaningful conversation around design thinking, requirements gathering, and critical thinking rather than a perfect design.
- Behavioral interviews probe motivations behind actions to assess cultural fit and teamwork potential.
- The key strategy for success across all interview types is clearly thinking out loud to demonstrate reasoning and foster interactive dialogue.
- Interview success is more about fit and thought process than simply getting every question right.

### Introduction
Tech interviews today are highly competitive and often inefficient. Despite the challenges, it's possible to significantly increase your chances of success by understanding the true intent behind the interview questions and adopting better preparation strategies. Steve Wyn, a former Amazon principal engineer and bar raiser who has conducted nearly a thousand technical interviews, shares insights and tips to help candidates clear tech interviews effectively.

### Understanding the Three Types of Interview Questions
Technical interviews typically consist of three categories of questions: coding, system design, and behavioral. Each question has a surface-level query and a deeper "question behind the question" that reveals what the interviewer is truly assessing.

#### Coding Questions
- Example: The classic FizzBuzz question is less about coding syntax and more about proving whether the candidate has ever coded before.
- The core evaluation is on problem-solving skills, not just delivering the optimal solution.
- Interviewers look for the candidate’s ability to reason through problems out loud, handle hints, and synthesize solutions on the spot.
- Simply drilling numerous coding problems misses the point if you don’t understand fundamental concepts and patterns.

### Receptiveness to Hints and Mental State
- Candidates often perform better when they are relaxed and comfortable, sometimes after a series of failed interviews.
- Relaxing reduces anxiety and helps get into a flow state, which is essential for good performance.
- Physical preparation such as adequate sleep, proper nutrition, and hydration is vital.
- Breathing exercises like box breathing (4-7-8 technique) can help calm nerves before an interview.
- Practicing mock interviews with friends or paid services helps get accustomed to nervousness gradually.

### Interview Practice Strategy
- Many candidates panic when getting a call for their dream job and rush preparation, leading to suboptimal performance.
- The best approach is to gain experience by interviewing with less desired companies first to improve skills.
- Interviewing is a numbers game where practice leads to improvement.
- Recruiters reach out broadly, so managing scheduling to peak for dream jobs later is advisable.

### Organizing Your Interview Process
- Managing multiple applications and prep tasks can become overwhelming and detrimental to performance.
- Tools like monday.com can help visually track applications, schedule mocks, and organize prep materials.
- Using dashboards and automations helps stay on top of follow-ups and interview preparation.
- Collaboration features allow sharing boards with peers for feedback and joint problem-solving.

### System Design Interviews
- Unlike coding interviews that have one correct answer, system design interviews emphasize meaningful conversation and the ability to think critically.
- Candidates should clarify requirements, define core entities and APIs, and outline a high-level design.
- Follow the interviewer’s lead during deep dives into scalability, use cases, or future extensibility.
- Common mistakes include trying to force prepared answers instead of flexibly engaging in discussion.
- The goal is to show critical thinking and participate in a thoughtful design conversation.

### Behavioral Interviews
- These assess past behaviors to predict future behavior and cultural fit.
- The "question behind the question" often centers around whether the candidate would be a good colleague.
- Strong answers include the motivation behind actions, not just the actions themselves.
- Sharing your thought process gives interviewers insight into how you think, improving your perceived fit.

### The Key to Success: Thinking Out Loud
- Articulate your reasoning transparently throughout coding, system design, and behavioral interviews.
- This increases the chance of receiving helpful hints and shows your problem-solving approach.
- Interviews are less a test and more like a conversation or date, focused on assessing fit.
- Demonstrating your thinking process helps build a connection with interviewers and shows you as a thoughtful collaborator.

### Conclusion
Tech interviews can feel daunting and broken, but understanding what interviewers really want helps demystify the process. Focus on problem-solving skills, critical thinking, motivation, and communication rather than pure memorization. Physical and mental preparation, strategic practice scheduling, and organizational tools can all contribute to peak performance. Lastly, always remember that the goal is to demonstrate that you’re someone teammates want to work with by sharing your thought process openly.

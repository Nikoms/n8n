## TLDR;
- Stack ranking and forced attrition create challenging company cultures but helping others builds a strong reputation that protects you.
- Amazon behavioral interviews require telling good, relevant stories that demonstrate leadership and experience.
- DJing and software development both require adapting to different roles and continuously learning.
- Career paths include rest/invest, advancing to senior roles, management, startups, content creation, or early retirement.
- Negotiation advice: no harm in asking for more, but emotional comfort is important.
- To advocate for promotion, provide concrete evidence of next-level work, not just reputation.
- Reapply to companies only after addressing reasons for previous rejection; consult recruiters for timelines.
- Boomerang hires should maintain professionalism, be honest about reasons for leaving, and demonstrate growth since departure.
- Brilliant.org offers interactive math, science, and CS courses highly recommended for deep learning, especially machine learning and quantum mechanics.

### Dealing with Toxic Company Culture and Stack Ranking
Stack ranking and forced attrition quotas can create a team environment where collaboration suffers because no one is incentivized to help others. Steve explains that while it might seem career growth is a zero-sum game, this mindset is a trap. The practice of stack ranking is about companies letting go of the bottom-performing employees to maintain standards—not personal attacks. He advises cultivating a reputation for helping others as a defense against being forced out, emphasizing long-term positive benefits over short-term politics. In toxic workplaces defined by backstabbing, he recommends seeking new employment instead of adapting to negative behaviors.

> "If you've cultivated a reputation for helping others around you, you're very unlikely to be forced out."

### Preparing for Amazon Behavioral Interviews
Steve addresses how to tackle Amazon's behavioral interviews by telling good stories relevant to the role's level. Candidates should not fabricate experiences but align their stories with their career stage. For senior roles, this includes leading teams through challenges like tight deadlines, vague requirements, under-resourcing, and critical bugs.

> "If you want to be a senior engineer, I would expect stories that outline your involvement in leading a team of software engineers."

### Lessons from DJing Applicable to Software Development
Drawing from his experience as a DJ, Steve shares two lessons:
- The type of work or music you want to do and what makes you successful may differ, especially early in your career. Accept the job's requirements professionally.
- Continuous learning is essential. Just like a DJ updates their playlist, developers should spend significant time reading and studying new tech and practices.

> "A DJ that has their set list chiseled in stone is in the same sad place as a web developer who has decided Ruby on Rails is all they ever need."

### Future Career Goals and Options
Steve outlines several potential career paths, including resting/investing, reaching senior technical levels (L8), going into management, starting or joining startups, content creation, or retiring early. These paths are not mutually exclusive and reflect flexibility and evolving priorities.

> "I'm in a good place right now because I have options. We'll see how all this plays out."

### Negotiating Job Offers and Raises
When offered what you ask for, Steve presents two perspectives: accept it or negotiate further. He notes asking for more has no downsides other than emotional discomfort. People should evaluate their personal comfort with negotiation but know they deserve pay matching their worth.

> "There are no consequences for asking for more. If they say no, you're back to where you started."

### Self-Advocacy for Promotion
Promotion should be backed by concrete evidence of handling greater scope, not just reputation. Steve advises candidates to leave tangible artifacts like design documents, detailed commit histories, and problem-solving tickets illustrating next-level work, akin to leaving a trail of fingerprints to prove involvement.

> "You want to be the world's worst criminal — leave your fingerprints everywhere."

### Reapplying to Companies
Steve recommends inquiring with recruiters about reapplication timelines and only reapplying after materially improving on interview weaknesses. Candidates should conduct retrospectives on failed interviews to understand gaps and address them before trying again.

> "Don't reapply until you have a good sense for why you didn't receive an offer and put work into addressing the root causes."

### Boomerang Employees Returning to Former Companies
Returning to a company you left on good terms is usually straightforward. If seeking promotion during return, treat the process like a new hire interview and provide fresh, concrete examples of growth. When explaining prior departure, be honest but demonstrate commitment to staying.

> "If you left because of money, explain why you won’t jump ship again. Emphasize what you truly miss about the company."

### Recommended Learning Resource: Brilliant.org
Steve highlights Brilliant.org as an interactive platform for learning math, science, and computer science. He praises its courses on machine learning, neural networks, reinforcement learning, quantum mechanics, and computational biology as engaging and effective for deep learning.

> "Passive reading or watching videos is probably the worst way to learn something. Brilliant offers interactive lessons that really help."

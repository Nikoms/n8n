### Promotion in Tech is Not About Technical Skills Alone
Getting promoted in tech is often misunderstood as a reward for technical excellence, but experience shows that it largely depends on other factors. Over the last year, working with nearly 500 tech professionals, it’s clear that technical skills, leadership, or communication style are not the main determinants of promotion. Instead, a fundamental mindset shift is essential.

### The Ride Share Metaphor: Taking Control of Your Career
Imagine being in a ride share stuck on a frustrating journey where the driver keeps passing your house while dropping off others. This mirrors how many people passively wait for their promotion, hoping it will come by recognition alone. The key difference is to "get in the driver’s seat"—take active control instead of waiting passively.

### What It Means to Take the Driver's Seat
Taking control does NOT mean waiting for your manager to notice your efforts or silently fixing problems. It means making your intentions crystal clear. For example, explicitly telling your manager during your next one-on-one, "I want to get promoted, and I'd like to understand what it will take," can transform your career conversation from passive to active.

### How Managers Influence Promotion Outcomes
A great manager facilitates growth, but many managers are busy and often waiting for you to initiate these conversations. If your manager resists or deflects, you have choices: repair the relationship, find a new supportive manager, or take other actions to advance. Remember, your promotion doesn't happen by chance but by you making it happen.

### Making the Uncomfortable Conversation
Many hesitate to discuss promotions fearing they appear pushy or disrespectful. However, not speaking up can cost years of growth. If direct talk about promotion is difficult, approach the topic through career growth discussions and prepare a checklist comparing your current performance to next-level criteria. This preparation facilitates productive conversations that progress your promotion journey.

### The Importance of Playing the Bigger Game
Technical excellence at your current level is not enough to get promoted. You must demonstrate the ability to handle bigger scope projects, cross-functional leadership, and broader business impact. Using the example of Ben, a talented coder stuck at senior level, the shift to understanding and demonstrating readiness for higher-level responsibilities is critical for promotion.

### Don't Wait for the Perfect Moment
Delaying the promotion attempt for a big project or the "right time" often results in missed opportunities. Promotion requirements don’t get easier; competition doesn’t decrease, and your past achievements fade. Act now even if conditions feel less than perfect. Being impatient with action is necessary to seize the opportunity.

### Summary and Call to Action
- Make your promotion intentions crystal clear.
- Have open and direct conversations with your manager.
- Understand and work on next-level criteria beyond your current technical scope.
- Don’t wait for the perfect project or moment.
- Persist despite managerial delays or reschedules.
- Start your promotion journey now and own it.

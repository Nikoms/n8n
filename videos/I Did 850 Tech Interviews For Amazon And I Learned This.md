### Starting Point: From Support Engineer to Software Developer
I began my career at Amazon in 2006 as a support engineer. The job was to keep the website operational, which was important but often felt like cleaning up others' mistakes. Carrying a pager and being paged over 100 times a week was exhausting, especially as I was often the only one on call due to team members leaving. This tough period motivated me to change my career path from support engineer to software developer. Inspired by Tony Robbins’ idea that change occurs when the pain of staying the same exceeds change, I dedicated myself to preparing for technical interviews.

### Lesson 1: Interviewing is a Numbers Game
A common mental block in interviewing is expecting to succeed every time. Interviewing should be approached like professional poker — where even the best hand can lose and the worst can win occasionally. I learned to line up multiple interviews simultaneously; for instance, I scheduled four interviews at once and received three job offers. This approach allows selectivity and avoids emotional investment in just one opportunity, which may lead to discouragement or delay.

Recruiters operate on their own schedules; some companies are fast while others slow. Therefore, start applying in parallel to optimize your chances. Segment companies into tiers, aiming for offers from your top tier and using lower-tier companies as practice to reduce nervousness. Preparing this way increases the likelihood of success.

### Lesson 2: Interviews Are Not Day-to-Day Skill Tests
Many candidates mistakenly prepare according to what they think should happen rather than what actually happens. Interviews are designed primarily to filter out bad candidates, not to replicate daily job tasks. For example, in system design interviews, questions are often proxy assessments rather than requests for real-world designs.

I once failed a system design question despite having built that system professionally because my answer diverged from the interviewer’s focus. Companies utilize proxy questions to minimize hiring risks and false positives. It's critical to listen carefully, follow the interviewer's cues, and adapt to their line of questioning. Playing the wrong “game” is a common pitfall — for example, treating a limited scope question as one with no limits.

### Lesson 3: The Behavioral Portion is Critical
Many candidates focus exclusively on technical skills during interview preparation, ignoring behavioral questions. The technical portion is the "ante" — necessary but not sufficient to secure an offer. Behavioral interviews assess your experience, work style, collaboration, and attitude. These questions help demonstrate qualities like fast learning, thoroughness, teamwork, and eagerness.

In my own interviews, I wasn’t always perfect technically but excelled in behavioral responses, which helped land multiple offers. Behavioral interviews can be the tipping point, particularly if your technical performance is uneven.

### Additional Advice
- Don't emotionally invest in one company or one interview.
- Practice interviews by applying to multiple companies simultaneously.
- Recognize interviewing is a numbers game; expect and accept some rejections.
- Prepare for and master both technical and behavioral interview components.

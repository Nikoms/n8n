## My thoughts

The video's key takeaway for me is the concept of selling the impact of what we've done, rather than simply detailing the tasks we completed. Highlighting the real-world consequences and business value of our activities provides a much more potent narrative for our achievements. It underscores not just our involvement but the significance of our contributions. It's food for thought that one ought to consider when discussing accomplishments, in an interview scenario, or simply reflecting on our career progress.

## TLDR;
- Career growth can be effectively managed using the 'magic loop'—a five-step process of doing your job well, asking how to help your manager, doing the tasks assigned, aligning tasks with personal goals, and repeating.
- The magic loop works in most situations, especially when managers are busy or less effective, and is applicable at all levels of a career.
- Career stagnation at senior manager levels (L7, M1, M2) is common due to organizational choke points; patience and practicing next-level skills are key.
- Inventiveness is a crucial leadership skill at Amazon, and systematic invention involves expertise, dedicated time, and combining existing ideas rather than only generating brand new ones.
- Failure in leadership roles is recoverable with ownership, proactive communication, and rebuilding trust, as exemplified by Ethan Evans' story with Jeff Bezos.
- Amazon's leadership principles, including 'ownership' and 'bias for action,' are foundational and have evolved with input from leaders like Ethan.
- Remote work has greater potential for innovation than traditional office environments.
- Interview success hinges significantly on professional appearance, enthusiasm, and demonstrating impact rather than just tasks done.
- Contrarian views shared include trusting in handshake agreements over heavy contracts and skepticism about mandated return to office policies.
- Ethan offers executive coaching and courses focusing on career development and leadership, especially helping senior managers break into executive roles.
- Key takeaways include owning your career growth, learning from failure, and understanding the importance of trust and effective communication.

### Introduction to the Magic Loop for Career Growth
Ethan Evans, a former Amazon VP and executive coach, shares a simple yet effective method called the "magic loop" to help employees advance their careers by building a partnership with their managers. The magic loop consists of five steps:

1. Do your current job well to at least a solid performance level.
2. Ask your manager how you can help to start building rapport.
3. Complete whatever tasks your manager asks, even if they are not exciting.
4. Revisit your manager with aligned goals, requesting tasks that help both your manager and your career ambitions.
5. Repeat the process continually.

This method works well even with busy or less-engaged managers by taking control of your career growth.

### Why the Magic Loop Works
The magic loop thrives on the human tendency to help those who help you, encouraging collaboration and building trust over time. It forces clarity on what you need to improve to reach the next level, which is often a vague expectation until discussed explicitly. This also helps managers understand your ambitions, clearing assumptions they may hold about your career desires.

### Applying the Magic Loop at Various Career Stages
Ethan explains the loop is valuable from entry-level through senior management. At senior or executive levels, proactive behavior without needing frequent check-ins becomes the norm, gradually shifting from asking "what can I do?" to suggesting initiatives aligned with organizational goals. However, building rapport and trust is essential before operating at this advanced mode.

### Getting Unstuck at Senior Leadership Levels
A common challenge is the 'choke point' in organizational hierarchy at senior manager (L7, M1, M2) and director levels, exacerbated by leaner organizational structures. Success depends on developing strategic thinking, influence, and coordination skills rather than just functional excellence. Displaying readiness and practicing these higher-level skills can help you be the natural choice when positions open or expansions occur.

### Inventiveness as a Leadership Principle
Inspired by Amazon leadership principles like "Think Big" and "Invent and Simplify," Ethan transformed into a systematically inventive leader during his 15 years at Amazon, accumulating over 70 patents. Invention is often about combining existing ideas—in his case merging concepts from aircraft carriers and drones to propose a drone-delivery truck concept.

He emphasizes that invention requires expertise, dedicated thinking time (around 2 hours a month), and persistent iteration. Most innovation at Amazon, Jeff Bezos notes, comes during the optimization or scaling phase rather than from initial ideas alone.

### Standout Interview Tips
Ethan highlights that the most significant interview factors are appearance and enthusiasm—projecting genuine interest in the role and company. Candidates should also emphasize the impact and business value of their work rather than just listing duties. For remote interviews, be fully present with camera on, good eye contact, and engaging body language.

### Managing Failure with Jeff Bezos
Ethan shares a vivid story of a failed launch of Amazon’s App Store under his leadership, detailing challenges with a database outage on launch day. Key lessons include:

- Taking full ownership and openly communicating updates regularly to manage trust.
- Engaging cross-team support promptly to solve critical issues.
- Meeting face-to-face to rebuild relationships.
- Working hard and fast post-failure to fix the problem.
- Overcoming impostor syndrome with persistence.

Despite public failure, Ethan rebuilt trust and within two years was promoted to Vice President, showing how recovery from setbacks is possible with the right approach.

### Insights on Amazon's Leadership Principles
Ethan contributed to defining the "ownership" leadership principle, famously coining the phrase "An owner never says that's not my job," which remains central to Amazon culture. He also champions "Bias for Action," encouraging calculated speed in decision-making, which is critical in competitive and fast-moving industries.

Amazon’s leadership principles continually evolve, reflecting lessons from diverse perspectives, including subtle references to diversity, equity, and inclusion.

### Contrarian Views
Ethan takes contrarian stands on several topics:

- He believes remote work has far more room for innovation and improvement than traditional office setups, which have been around for 300 years with little evolution.
- He values doing business on trust and handshake agreements over heavy reliance on contracts, advocating for assuming good faith.

### Additional Career Advice and Resource Recommendations
Ethan recommends books like "Decisive" by Chip and Dan Heath, "Leadership and Self-Deception" by The Arbinger Institute, and the "Almanack of Naval Ravikant" for making better decisions, improving interpersonal dynamics, and building unique career value.

He also shares practical tips for interviews and suggests engaging with his coaching and courses, particularly for senior managers aiming to reach executive levels.

### Where to Connect and Continuing Growth
Listeners can connect with Ethan Evans on LinkedIn (handle: Ethan Evans VP), where he shares career advice and leadership insights. He encourages readers to comment and contribute their perspectives to refine collective understanding.

Currently, Ethan coaches and runs a popular course focused on breaking through the senior manager level to executive roles, helping professionals navigate career growth and leadership skills.

### Conclusion
Ethan Evans’ journey through Amazon and beyond offers a roadmap for career development, handling failure, fostering inventiveness, and developing leadership skills. The magic loop provides a practical framework for career growth regardless of your manager's capabilities, while his leadership principles and personal stories stress ownership, trust, and continuous improvement.

By adopting these principles and approaches, professionals can better navigate stagnation, stand out in interviews, and leverage their unique inventiveness to grow and succeed in their careers.

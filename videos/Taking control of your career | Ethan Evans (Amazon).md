## My thoughts

One should focus more on the impact of the work, rather than just the activities performed as it speaks volumes about one's contribution and effectiveness.

## TLDR;
- The Magic Loop is a five-step process to grow your career by building a partnership with your manager: do your job well, ask how to help, do what is asked, align your goals with helping your manager, and repeat.
- The Magic Loop works best in situations where managers are busy or less thoughtful about employee growth and helps advance careers from entry-level to senior leadership stages.
- Career progression beyond senior manager level often requires patience due to limited roles and a shift from task execution to strategic leadership and influence.
- Systematic invention involves expertise, dedicated thinking time, and combining existing ideas in new ways; two hours a month is often enough time.
- Failure is survivable with ownership, proactive communication, timely problem-solving, and repairing trust; Ethan shared a story of recovering from a major product launch failure under Jeff Bezos.
- Amazon's leadership principles, especially 'Ownership' and 'Bias for Action,' emphasize accountability and speed; Ethan contributed the phrase "An owner never says that's not my job."
- Contrarian views include skepticism about returning fully to offices due to remote work opportunities and valuing personal trust over excessive legal contracts.
- Key interview advice: Show enthusiasm, dress appropriately, be present, and highlight the impact and business relevance of your work.

### Introduction
In this insightful conversation with Ethan Evans, a former Amazon VP and executive coach, we explore practical career growth strategies, the nature of invention, handling failure, Amazon's leadership principles, contrarian views on work culture, and key tips for interviews and leadership.

### The Magic Loop: Growing Your Career
Ethan introduces the "Magic Loop," a five-step process to advance your career even in challenging managerial situations:
- **Step 1:** Do your current job well; be at least solid in performance.
- **Step 2:** Ask your manager how you can help.
- **Step 3:** Do what your manager asks, even if it's not glamorous.
- **Step 4:** Align your goals with the manager’s needs; ask how you can help in ways that also benefit your career objectives.
- **Step 5:** Repeat this process regularly to build trust and partnership.

This approach works because managers tend to help those who help them, fostering mutual success. It is especially valuable when managers lack the time or thoughtfulness to proactively support your career. Importantly, clarifying your goals with your manager removes ambiguity and helps focus your efforts.

### Career Progression Challenges
Ethan discusses the common issue of getting stuck at senior manager levels (L7/M1/M2), noting a bottleneck due to limited higher roles and the shift in leadership expectations towards strategic thinking and influence. Career advancement here requires patience and proactively developing skills that demonstrate readiness for higher roles. Practicing next-level leadership traits and showcasing strategic initiatives can increase your chances.

### Systematic Invention
Invention is about more than sudden inspiration; it requires expertise, dedicated focus time (even just two hours a month), and combining existing ideas innovatively. Using examples like Amazon Prime and Kindle, Ethan emphasizes that success often comes from ongoing optimization and incremental improvements rather than one-off ideas. Invention is a process that can be learned and practiced.

### Failure and Recovery
Ethan shares a candid story of a failed Amazon App Store launch that angered Jeff Bezos. Key lessons include:
- **Ownership:** Admit faults immediately.
- **Proactive Communication:** Provide frequent, clear updates to rebuild trust.
- **Mobilize Help:** Bring in experts to solve problems urgently.
- **Face the Consequences:** Don’t avoid difficult conversations; engage honestly and directly.
Ethan stresses that even high-profile failures can be overcome with the right attitude and persistence.

### Amazon Leadership Principles
Ethan helped draft the language for Amazon's "Ownership" principle, notably the phrase "An owner never says that's not my job," which encapsulates accountability culture at Amazon. He also highlights "Bias for Action," which values speed and decisiveness even in uncertain conditions. These principles guide behavior and decision-making across Amazon's large workforce.

### Contrarian Views
Ethan challenges popular opinions on returning fully to office work, arguing offices have limited potential for significant improvement while remote work has vast unexplored opportunities. He also values trust-based business dealings over reliance on contracts, emphasizing personal integrity and commitment.

### Interview and Career Advice
For candidates:
- Appear enthusiastic and professional.
- Be fully present, especially in virtual interviews, maintaining eye contact and engagement.
- Focus on describing the impact of your work, not just activities performed.

### Final Thoughts
Ethan offers resources including his LinkedIn, newsletter, executive coaching, and courses focused on career development and leadership. His story and advice encourage taking proactive control of your career, embracing invention, learning from failure, and embodying ownership to succeed.

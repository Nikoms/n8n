## My thoughts

Refined thoughts:

The focus should be on highlighting the impact of our accomplishments, rather than merely listing what we've done.

### The Magic Loop: A Simple Framework to Grow Your Career
Ethan Evans shared his popular "Magic Loop" career advancement method that involves five simple steps: do your current job well, ask your manager how you can help, do what they ask, align those efforts with your career goals, and repeat continuously. The loop builds trust and partnership with leadership and is effective even with challenging managers. This proactive approach is crucial as many managers are busy and not skilled at managing employee development.

### Overcoming Career Plateaus and Getting Promoted
A common challenge for senior managers is getting stuck before reaching director or executive levels. Evans explains that progression requires developing strategic thinking and leading through influence rather than just technical or functional excellence. He advocates practicing next-level skills early and making yourself indispensable by taking on higher-impact projects.

### Embracing Failure and Rebuilding Trust
Evans recounted a high-profile failure launching Amazon’s App Store feature which frustrated Jeff Bezos. His approach of owning the problem, communicating frequently, and seeking help to fix it, ultimately rebuilt trust leading to his promotion to vice president. Key lessons include transparency, prioritization, and keeping a strong work ethic even in hard times.

### Amazon Leadership Principles and Their Impact
Evans helped craft the language for Amazon’s famous leadership principle "Ownership," highlighted by the phrase "An owner never says that's not my job." He also favors "Bias for Action," emphasizing speed and decisiveness balanced with care. These principles guide millions of employees globally on accountability and taking initiative.

### Innovation and Inventiveness: The Real Work Behind Ideas
Drawing on his experience at Amazon, Evans explains that inventiveness is largely about combining existing knowledge and spending dedicated time (even as little as two hours a month) to generate ideas. Most innovation is incremental, iteratively improving products like Amazon Prime over decades - the hard work is optimizing and scaling ideas rather than just the initial spark.

### Interview Tips: Enthusiasm and Impact Matter Most
Evans advises candidates to demonstrate enthusiasm and professional appearance during interviews, especially virtually, and to emphasize the business impact of their work rather than just listing tasks. Showing you understand and contributed to solving problems positions you as a leader.

### Contrarian Views: Remote Work and Trust
Evans is skeptical of mandatory return-to-office policies, citing the long history of office design and untapped opportunity for remote work innovation. He also values doing business based on trust and a person’s word instead of over-reliance on contracts, believing this reduces friction and promotes better relationships.

### Coaching and Helping Leaders Break Through
Currently, Ethan Evans coaches senior managers and leaders to break through career plateaus and adapt their leadership style for higher roles. His flagship course "Stuck at Senior Manager - Breaking Through to Executive" focuses on the difficult transitions from functional excellence to strategic leadership.

### Final Thoughts
Career growth hinges on taking ownership, communicating clearly, embracing learning from failure, and building partnerships with your leaders. Innovation is a marathon, not a sprint, and requires focus. By practicing the Magic Loop and internalizing leadership principles, professionals can navigate challenges and accelerate success.

## My thoughts

This video featuring Ethan Evans provides an insightful five-step approach to career advancement, perfect for those looking to level up. It emphasizes the importance of understanding and fulfilling your manager's expectations, asking how you can assist them, performing what your manager requests, discussing your ambitions and aligning tasks to those desires, and regularly engaging in this cycle. By focusing on these steps, individuals can uncover gaps in their performance and align their roles more closely with their career aspirations.

## TLDR;
- The "magic loop" is a five-step career growth process involving doing your job well, asking your manager how to help, doing what you're asked, discussing mutual goals, and repeating.
- The magic loop works especially well when managers are busy or less engaged and is applicable from entry to senior leadership levels.
- Getting stuck at senior manager level is common due to organizational choke points and a shift in required leadership behaviors from execution to influence and strategy.
- Inventiveness can be systematically developed by dedicating focused time, leveraging expertise, and combining existing ideas rather than waiting for pure inspiration.
- Jeff Bezos values invention and bias for action; being fast and willing to take reversible decisions is crucial.
- Key leadership principles at Amazon include Ownership ("an owner never says that's not my job") and Bias for Action.
- In interviews, enthusiasm, appearance, and demonstrating impact rather than just effort stand out.
- Failure management: Own mistakes immediately, communicate proactively with updates, work hard to fix issues, and seek to rebuild trust.
- Remote work has more room for innovation compared to traditional office work, and over-reliance on contracts undermines trust.
- Ethan Evans offers coaching and courses focused on career advancement and leadership, especially to senior managers aiming for executive roles.

### Introduction
In this extensive interview, Ethan Evans, a former Amazon VP with 15 years of experience and over 70 patents, shares profound insights into career growth, invention, managing failure, leadership principles, and more. The conversation covers actionable advice for professionals seeking advancement, stories of resilience, and contrarian views on workplace culture.

### The Magic Loop: A Simple Career Growth Framework
Ethan outlines a five-step process called the "magic loop" that helps individuals grow their career in almost any environment—even with difficult managers. The steps are:

1. **Do your job well:** Ensure you meet your manager's expectations; being at least solidly performing is necessary before further growth.
2. **Ask your manager how you can help:** This builds rapport and signals your willingness to support.
3. **Do what your manager asks:** Even unglamorous tasks help build trust.
4. **Discuss your goals and align tasks:** Share what skills or roles you want to develop and ask if tasks can be aligned to those goals.
5. **Repeat the loop:** Continuously engage with your manager, building a supportive partnership.

Ethan emphasizes that this works because managers naturally help those who help them. It also helps clarify the performance gaps and goals that sometimes remain implicit until performance reviews. This framework is particularly useful where managers may be busy, inexperienced, or unaware of employees' goals.

### Using the Magic Loop at All Career Levels
From entry-level to senior management, the magic loop remains effective. At senior levels, explicit conversations about "how I can help you" may taper off as expectations shift to proactive leadership. However, the principles of trust, partnership, and goal alignment persist. Ethan shares inspiring stories of individuals who applied these steps and advanced significantly, including a senior manager who grew to a VP level and managed 800 people.

### Overcoming Stagnation at Senior Manager Level
Ethan acknowledges a common career choke point at the senior manager level due to organizational structure and increasing managerial scope. Breaking through requires:

- Patience for the right role to exist
- Developing strategic thinking, influence, and letting go of detail-oriented execution
- Building trust and demonstrating capability to do the next-level job before being promoted

He encourages actively practicing next-level skills and using the magic loop to demonstrate value and readiness.

### Systematic Inventiveness and Innovation
Inspired by Amazon’s leadership principles "Think Big" and "Invent and Simplify," Ethan explains how invention is less about sudden ideas and more about systematic, incremental innovation. Key points:

- Dedicate focused time (as little as two hours a month) to deliberate inventive thinking
- Combine existing concepts from different domains to generate new ideas (e.g., drone delivery using an aircraft carrier analogy)
- Many big ideas (like Amazon Prime) remain works in progress for years, focusing heavily on optimization and incremental improvements

This mindset has helped Ethan earn over 70 patents and contributed to Amazon’s culture of invention.

### Interviewing: Standing Out as a Candidate
Ethan highlights that beyond skills, enthusiasm and professionalism significantly influence interview outcomes. Specifically:

- Show up engaged, attentive, and enthusiastic even over Zoom (dress well, have camera on, make eye contact)
- Speak about your impact and outcomes, not just your work or tasks
- Demonstrate understanding of business problems and how you contributed solutions

### Managing Failure: A Story of Launching Amazon’s App Store
Ethan shares a candid story about a public failure involving a flawed App Store launch that angered Jeff Bezos. His approach to recovery included:

- Owning the problem fully and immediately
- Communicating proactively with precise, frequent updates
- Mobilizing help and working hard to fix the problem
- Meeting with Jeff Bezos in person to rebuild trust
- Persisting despite shame and skepticism about his capability

He stresses that errors—even very public and costly ones—are survivable if handled with ownership and determination.

### Amazon’s Leadership Principles: Ownership and Bias for Action
Ethan helped rewrite Amazon's leadership principle of Ownership, famously contributing the phrase "An owner never says that's not my job." This principle underscores accountability and proactive responsibility.

He also admires Bias for Action, which pushes for speed and decisiveness, accepting that some decisions are reversible. While this approach caused his launch failure, the balance between speed and caution remains essential.

### Contrarian Views
Ethan shares two contrarian opinions:

- **Remote Work:** Despite some organizational desire to return fully to offices, he believes office work is a mature, limited paradigm. Remote work has much room for improvement and innovation.
- **Doing Business on Trust Rather Than Contracts:** Over-reliance on contracts can erode trust. Ethan prefers building relationships where one’s word and commitments hold weight, accepting occasional risks.

### Lightning Round: Personal Preferences and Recommendations
- **Books:** "Decisive" by Chip and Dan Heath; "Leadership and Self-Deception" by The Arbinger Institute; and "The Almanack of Naval Ravikant" for career and life wisdom.
- **TV Show:** Taylor Sheridan’s "Yellowstone" series
- **Favorite Interview Question:** "Tell me about a time you disagreed with management."
- **Favorite Product:** Chuck it ball thrower for dogs
- **Life Motto:** "To whom much is given, from him much will be required," reflecting on personal responsibility and paying it forward.
- **Space Travel:** Would embrace the risk and opportunity to be an early adopter despite dangers.

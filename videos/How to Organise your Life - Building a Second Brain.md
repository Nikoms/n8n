## My thoughts

The video explains that organizing information by actionability rather than by source or topic makes it far more practical to use. Instead of sorting notes by whether they’re from a book or a podcast, you group them based on the project or output you want to apply them to. This approach helps you focus on what you need to do with the information, making it easier to retrieve and apply when working on specific tasks.

## TLDR;
- Information overwhelm is a common problem from consuming vast amounts of content daily.
- Building a second brain is a digital system for capturing, organising, distilling, and expressing ideas to handle information overload.
- The 'CODE' framework stands for Capture, Organise, Distill, and Express.
- Digital note-taking apps like Apple Notes or Notion enable efficient idea storage and retrieval.
- Organising information by actionability (e.g., project-based) is more effective than organising by source/type.
- Progressive summarization helps highlight the most important parts of notes.
- Expressing knowledge through creation (videos, presentations, writing) is the ultimate goal of second brain.
- The system enables slow burns on multiple projects, reducing stress and improving productivity and creativity.
- Examples include preparing talks quickly and managing ongoing book or video projects.
- Digital commonplace books build on historical practices but leverage technology for searchability and organisation.

### Introduction to Information Overwhelm and the Second Brain Concept

In our modern world, information overwhelm has become one of the most annoying problems. We consume vast amounts of content daily—books, podcasts, videos—but often end up overloaded and unsure of how to apply that knowledge. In the episode of Book Club, Ali introduces _Building a Second Brain_ by Tiago Forte, which addresses this challenge.

The core premise centers around building a "second brain," a digital commonplace book, as a solution to store, process, and use information effectively.

> "This system, the second brain system, helps you solve that problem [information overload]."

### What is a Second Brain and Why Have One?

The concept originates from the old practice of commonplace books used by great creatives like Leonardo Da Vinci and contemporary figures such as Taylor Swift and Jerry Seinfeld. These books served to capture inspirations, ideas, anecdotes, and musings in one place.

Ali emphasizes that many of us do not take the first critical step to combat information overload: writing things down. Instead, ideas and quotes are often forgotten because we rely on our memory.

The second brain transforms this analogue idea into a digital system, leveraging today's technology to capture thoughts from both internal (musings, ideas) and external sources (books, podcasts, conversations).

> "Instead of making an analogue commonplace book, we can make a digital commonplace book."

Even if you are not a creative content producer, the second brain is useful because "every job these days involves knowledge work of some kind." Whether you're a doctor, consultant, or investment banker, handling information input, processing it, and creating outputs is core to modern work.

### The CODE Framework: Building Your Second Brain

Tiago Forte's method to build a second brain is encapsulated in the CODE framework:

#### Capture
- Capture any ideas, quotes, thoughts, or highlights that resonate.
- Use simple tools like Apple Notes or Notion for digital capture.
- Examples include book highlights, podcast quotes, meeting notes, website links, or personal musings.

> "Your brain is for having ideas, not for holding them." — David Allen

#### Organise
- Avoid organising notes by their source (book, podcast) which is less actionable.
- Instead, organise notes by projects or actionability—where will this information be used?
- For instance, save materials related to a video script or book chapter into that specific project folder.
- This aligns information with output goals rather than topics.

#### Distill
- Use progressive summarization to highlight and distill the most important insights from your notes.
- This method goes beyond traditional highlighting by layering summarization to make essentials stand out.

#### Express
- The final step is to use the captured and processed information to create or share something.
- Expression isn’t limited to creative content; it includes consulting presentations, investment strategies, or teaching.
- Sharing knowledge and making something tangible is the ultimate purpose.

> "It's all well and good, hoarding ideas and keeping them in a note-taking app, but unless we're expressing those ideas—sharing them with the world—they're kind of useless."

### Practical Benefits and Use Cases

Ali shares how the second brain system has transformed his productivity and creativity:

- **Slow burns vs. heavy lifts:** Multiple projects can simmer simultaneously as new information steadily accumulates, meaning less last-minute heavy lifting.
- **Rapid preparation:** Using the system, Ali prepared a talk in just two minutes while in an Uber, demonstrating the efficiency of a well-organised second brain.
- **Sourcing material:** Old notes and highlights serve as foundations for book chapters or video scripts, rediscovering valuable ideas previously forgotten.
- **Stress reduction:** By offloading information to the app, mental clutter is reduced, lowering stress and freeing brain space for creativity.

### Summary

Building a second brain using the CODE framework offers a structured way to tackle information overwhelm:

- Capture ideas digitally and continuously.
- Organise by projects and actionability, not by source.
- Distill key insights to easily review and apply.
- Express ideas through meaningful output.

This method, modernised by technology, revives the timeless practice of commonplace books and helps knowledge workers across disciplines thrive in an era of abundant information.

## My thoughts

Start by defining the feedback you want to receive and work backwards from it. Operate at a broader scope that clearly demonstrates your ability to perform at the next level, as high performance at your current level isn’t enough for promotion. Concrete evidence of handling bigger responsibilities and specific contributions trumps vague praise when making your case for advancement.

## TLDR;
- Promotions are not meritocracies but processes that can be understood and optimized.
- You must own and understand the promotion process at your company to avoid setbacks.
- Tech promotions require demonstrating competence at the next level, not just current high performance.
- Provide concrete evidence of operating at the next level rather than generic praise.
- Write desired feedback for your reviewers to help them provide strong, specific endorsements.
- Understanding and targeting the promotion criteria makes career growth less ambiguous and more achievable.

### Understanding the Promotion Process is Key
In the first quarter of 2020, after several failed attempts, I was finally promoted to principal engineer at Amazon. Although I received hundreds of congratulations, the promotion did not feel as joyful as one might expect. This is because I had failed five times over the previous four years. My journey from a senior software developer (SD3) to principal engineer (L7) was marked by frustration and confusion.

"Promotions aren't a meritocracy; they're a process."

Early in my career, promotions felt straightforward—I advanced quickly from support engineer in 2006 to senior SD by 2012. But getting from senior SD to principal engineer was different. Performance alone wasn’t enough; understanding the process was critical. Companies change their promotion criteria and processes, sometimes without clear communication. For instance, during my attempts, the promotion process was revised three times, which affected my ability to complete necessary steps on time.

### Demonstrate Competence at the Next Level
A story from mentoring a colleague named Lance illustrates an important lesson: excelling at your current level doesn’t guarantee promotion. Lance was an exceptional engineer at his current level but failed to get promoted because he didn’t demonstrate readiness for the next level.

"Tech promotions are anti-Peter Principle; you must demonstrate competence at the next level before promotion."

Lance learned this and on his next project took on responsibilities beyond what was expected. This strategic move led to his promotion just three months later. The takeaway is that promotions reward the ability to handle broader scope, not just excellent current-level work.

### The Power of Concrete Evidence Over Generic Praise
Imagine choosing between two surgeons for life-saving heart surgery: one acclaimed with glowing but general testimonials, the other boasting a 95% success rate. Which would you trust?

This analogy applies to promotions. Relying on vague endorsements like "Steve is a great engineer" is not enough. Instead, promotion packets must contain specific examples showing how a candidate performed next-level work.

For example, instead of saying "Steve was instrumental to project X," a stronger statement is:

> "Steve designed, coded, and delivered a critical component that improved client response time from 100ms to under 10ms by recognizing optimization opportunities."

Encouraging your feedback providers to give this type of targeted, evidence-backed feedback will strengthen your promotion case significantly.

### How to Get Better Feedback
You usually know who will write your promotion feedback. Write drafts of the feedback you'd want them to provide, even before the project finishes. Conduct your work to elicit that feedback naturally, and gently remind them at promotion time.

I use a similar approach on my YouTube channel, by envisioning the positive comments I aim to receive and then tailoring content to generate those responses.

### Conclusion and Further Resources
If you found these insights valuable, consider registering for my "Speedrun to Promotion" launch event, where I explain the structured promotion algorithm I developed. Also, watch my videos on common blockers to promotion at senior and principal levels to further accelerate your career growth.

Remember, promotion is a process you can understand and optimize. Take charge, aim for concrete evidence of next-level skills, and shape the feedback you receive to match your goals.

## Page 6

> We put in about 40 hours a week most of the year and just 32 in the summer. We send people on month- long sabbaticals every three years. We not only pay for people’s vacation time, we pay for the actual vacation, too.


----
## Page 10

> We work on projects for six weeks at a time, then we take two weeks off from scheduled work to roam and decompress.


----
## Page 42

> If you can’t fit everything you want to do within 40 hours per week, you need to get better at picking what to do, not work longer hours.


----
## Page 44

> Instead, we ask people to write updates daily or weekly on Basecamp for others to read when they have a free moment.


----
## Page 44

> It’s sad to think that some people crave a commute because it’s the only time during the day they have to themselves. 2


----
## Page 50

> Instead of adding to-dos, we add to-don’ts.


----
## Page 54

> Modern-day offices have become interruption factories.


----

> The person with the question needed something and they got it. The person with the answer was doing something else and had to stop. That’s rarely a fair trade. The problem comes when you make it too easy—and always acceptable—to pose any question as soon as it comes to mind. Most questions just aren’t that pressing, but the urge to ask the expert immediately is irresistible.


----
## Page 57

> All subject-matter experts at Basecamp now publish office hours.


----
## Page 63

> Meetings should be a last resort, especially big ones.


----
## Page 66

> Are there exceptions? Of course. It might be good to know who’s around in a true emergency, but 1 percent occasions like that shouldn’t drive policy 99 percent of the time.


----
## Page 78

> The best companies aren’t families. They’re supporters of families. 3


----
## Page 81

> “Another concept we talk a lot about is something called a ‘trust battery.’ It’s charged at 50 percent when people are first hired. And then every time you work with someone at the company, the trust battery between the two of you is either charged or discharged, based on things like whether you deliver on what you promise.”

## Page 85

> The fact is that the higher you go in an organization, the less you’ll know what it’s really like. It might seem perverse, but the CEO is usually the last to know. With great power comes great ignorance.


----
## Page 94

> Managers need double the empathy, not half a ration.


----
## Page 96

> just be responsible with your time and make sure your team knows when you won’t be around.


----
## Page 101

> It doesn’t matter how good you are at the job if you’re an ass.


----
## Page 105

> At Basecamp, we all do the work, so influence is most effectively exerted by leading the work, not by calling for it.


----
## Page 105

> The quickest way to disappointment is to set unreasonable expectations. 4


----
## Page 117

> Here’s a list of relevant “outside the office” benefits we offer all employees, regardless of position, regardless of salary:


----
## Page 120

> That’s because it’s really a library for work rather than an office for distraction.


----
## Page 137

> Our projects can only get smaller over time, not larger.


----
## Page 137

> And who makes the decision about what stays and what goes in a fixed period of time? The team that’s working on it. Not the CEO, not the CTO.


----
## Page 138

> A deadline with a flexible scope invites pushback, compromises, and tradeoffs


----
## Page 138

> It’s when you try to fix both scope and time that you have a recipe for dread, overwork, and exhaustion.


----
## Page 140

> Give it a try sometime. Don’t meet, write. Don’t react, consider.


----
## Page 143

> instead of shipping big software updates on Fridays, we now wait until Monday 5


----
## Page 149

> Later is where good intentions go to die.


----
## Page 156

> Being clear about what demands excellence and what’s perfectly okay just being adequate is a great way to bring a sense of calm into your work. You’ll worry less, you’ll accept more.


----
## Page 157

> It’s almost impossible to work on something and not be tempted to chase all the exciting new what-if and we-could-also ideas that come up.


----
## Page 157

> The deadline should be comfortably approaching, not scarily arriving.


----
## Page 158

> Once the initial exploration is over, every week should lead us closer to being done, not further from it. Commit to an idea.


----
## Page 158

> Accept that better ideas aren’t necessarily better if they arrive after the train has left the station. If they’ re so good, they can catch the next one.


----
## Page 170

> You’re probably just trying to meet some arbitrary deadline set by those who don’t actually have to do the work. 6


----
## Page 172

> The only way to get more done is to have less to do.


----
## Page 172

> “There is nothing so useless as doing efficiently that which should not be done at all.”


----
## Page 174

> Any conversation with more than three people is typically a conversation with too many people.


----
## Page 176

> That’s why rather than jumping on every new idea right away, we make every idea wait a while. Generally a few weeks, at least. That’s just enough time either to forget about it completely or to realize you can’t stop thinking about it.


----
## Page 177

> Having a box full of stale work is no fun. Happiness is shipping: finishing good work, sending it off, and then moving on to the next idea.


----
## Page 178

> No is easier to do, yes is easier to say.


----
## Page 178

> Yes is no to a thousand things.


----
## Page 179

> When you say no now, you can come back and say yes later. If you say yes now, it’s harder to say no later. 7


----
## Page 201

> That’s what promises lead to—rushing, dropping, scrambling, and a tinge of regret at the earlier promise that was a bit too easy to make.


----
## Page 201

> Promises are easy and cheap to make, actual work is hard and expensive. If it wasn’t, you’d just have done it now rather than promised it later.


----
## Page 207

> Your “new and improved” can easily become their “what the fuck?” when it is dumped on them as a surprise.


----
## Page 215

> Keep that in mind the next time you take a token. Which one are you leaving for the customer?

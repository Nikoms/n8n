## Page 43

> Individuals and interactions over processes and tools. Working software over comprehensive documentation. Customer collaboration over contract negotiation. Responding to change over following a plan.


----
## Page 45

> Good, fast, cheap, done: Pick any three you like. You can’t have the fourth.


----
## Page 48

> Agile development is first and foremost a feedback-driven approach.


----
## Page 49

> This is the world of the software development team. It’s a world in which dates are frozen and requirements are continuously changing.


----
## Page 58

> This loss of hope is a major goal of Agile. We practice Agile in order to destroy hope before that hope can kill the project. 2


----
## Page 58

> Hope is the project killer. Hope is what makes a software team mislead managers about their true progress.


----
## Page 58

> Some folks think that Agile is about going fast. It’s not. It’s never been about going fast. Agile is about knowing, as early as possible, just how screwed we are.


----
## Page 60

> Brooks’ law22 states: Adding manpower to a late project makes it later.


----
## Page 63

> Agile is a process wherein a project is subdivided into iterations. The output of each iteration is measured and used to continuously evaluate the schedule. Features are implemented in the order of business value so that the most valuable things are implemented first. Quality is kept as high as possible. The schedule is primarily managed by manipulating scope.


----
## Page 66

> Collective Ownership ensures that the team does not divide the project into a set of knowledge silos.


----
## Page 78

> You may have noticed that programming teams can often go very fast in the first few months of a greenfield project.


----
## Page 78

> Unfortunately, as time passes, the messes in the code can accumulate. If that code is not kept clean and orderly, it will put a back pressure on the team that slows progress. 3


----
## Page 79

> “Redesign the system from scratch.” The developers say.


----
## Page 81

> The word “ware” means “product.” The word “soft” means easy to change.


----
## Page 81

> If a change to the requirements breaks your architecture, then your architecture sucks.


----
## Page 82

> The older a software system is, the better it should be.


----
## Page 84

> QA should find no faults with the system.


----
## Page 86

> Manual testing should be limited to those things that cannot be automatically validated and to the creative discipline of Exploratory Testing.5


----
## Page 91

> In short, we cannot agree to deliver fixed scopes on hard dates. Either the scopes or the dates must be soft.


----
## Page 91

> The business has the right to expect that the developers will work on the most important things at any given time, and that each iteration will provide them the maximum possible usable business value. 4


----
## Page 91

> The customers choose the stories that give them the highest return on investment and that can fit within the developer’s estimation for the iteration.


----
## Page 93

> Developers have the right to do good work. The business has no right to tell developers to cut corners or do low-quality work. Or, to say this differently, the business has no right to force developers to ruin their professional reputations or violate their professional ethics.


----
## Page 100

> This rejection of detail is a discipline. And it’s hard. Everyone on the team will feel the need to capture all the details discussed in one way or another. Resist this urge!


----
## Page 101

> What makes a story manageable, schedulable, and estimable is the temporary lack of detail.


----
## Page 103

> They are not even estimated time—they are estimated effort.


----
## Page 104

> The team is not making a promise to get 30 points done during the iteration. They aren’t even making the promise to try to get 30 points done. This is nothing more than their best guess as to how many points will be complete by the end of the iteration. That guess is probably not very accurate.


----
## Page 105

> The four-quadrant game 5


----
## Page 107

> The project is not over when all the stories are implemented. The project is over when there are no more stories in the deck worth implementing.


----
## Page 108

> The details are recorded later, but as acceptance tests,


----
## Page 108

> For example, the business might ask for a fancy drag-and-drop interface to some feature. The developers could recommend a simpler checkbox style by saying that it would be much less expensive to develop.


----
## Page 109

> Refactoring is never a story. Architecture is never a story. Code cleanup is never a story.


----
## Page 109

> A story is always something that the business values.


----
## Page 112

> A spike is a meta-story, or rather, a story for estimating a story.


----
## Page 113

> If QA has not already begun to write the automated acceptance tests, they should start as soon as the IPM ends.


----
## Page 113

> Acceptance test writing should go quickly. We expect them to all be written before the midpoint of the iteration. 6


----
## Page 114

> some of the developers should stop working on stories and start working on acceptance tests.


----
## Page 114

> QA should be working on the tests for the next iteration.


----
## Page 114

> The definition of “done” is this: acceptance tests pass.


----
## Page 114

> Again, we don’t want to end the iteration with two half-done stories when we could have sacrificed one story in order to get the other one done.


----
## Page 115

> This is not about going fast. This is about making concrete, measurable progress.


----
## Page 115

> It is best if the stakeholders themselves operate the system so that the developers aren’t tempted to hide things that don’t work.


----
## Page 115

> The burn-down slope predicts the date for the next major milestone.


----
## Page 116

> The lesson here is that velocity is a measurement not an objective. It’s control theory 101: don’t put pressure on the thing you are measuring.


----
## Page 116

> Remember, the only failing iteration is an iteration that fails to produce data. 7


----
## Page 116

> One reason that teams fail to refactor enough is that they don’t write enough unit tests, so they fear that refactoring will break something that used to work.


----
## Page 116

> As velocity falls, pressure on the team builds. This causes the points to inflate.


----
## Page 116

> One way to avoid inflation is to constantly compare story estimates back to the original Golden Story,


----
## Page 126

> The business writes formal tests describing the behavior of each user story, and developers automate those tests.


----
## Page 126

> The tests are written by business analysts and QA before the first half of the iteration


----
## Page 127

> QA’s role is to write the unhappy paths.


----
## Page 127

> And, of course, the developers work with QA and business analysts to ensure that the tests make sense from a technical point of view.


----
## Page 128

> can meet any deadline you set for me, as long as the software doesn’t have to work properly.”

> is the programmers’ job to run the tests. 8


----
## Page 139

> There are extenuating circumstances for which the only option is to work overtime. But they should be extremely rare.


----
## Page 140

> The most precious ingredient in the life of a programmer is sufficient sleep.


----
## Page 141

> The team owns the code collectively.


----
## Page 143

> merged them with the main line every “couple of hours.”


----
## Page 147

> This meeting is optional. Many teams get by just fine without one. It can be less often than daily. Pick the schedule that makes sense to you. It should take ∼10 minutes, even for large teams.


----
## Page 147

> Perhaps the best description of the standup meeting is on Ward’s wiki: http://wiki.c2.com/? StandUpMeeting


----
## Page 147

> The gist is that only developers should speak at the standup. Managers and other folks may listen in but should not interject. 9


----
## Page 148

> Shout-out One modification that I have enjoyed is to add an optional fourth question: Whom do you want to thank?


----
## Page 149

> Without TDD, Refactoring, Simple Design, and yes, even Pair Programming, Agile becomes an ineffective flaccid shell of what it was intended to be.


----
## Page 151

> Programmers who learn TDD are taught to enter every behavior one at a time


----
## Page 154

> tests are the perfect kind of documentation for programmers: code.


----
## Page 154

> If you have ever written tests after the fact, you know that it’s not a lot of fun. It’s not fun because you already know the code works. You’ve tested it manually. You are likely writing those tests because someone told you that you had to. It feels like busy work. It’s boring.


----
## Page 154

> It doesn’t feel like busy work—it feels like getting stuff working.


----
## Page 155

> And since you have left holes in the test suite, you suspect everyone else has, too.


----
## Page 155

> only information that the passing tests give you is that nothing tested is broken. The incompleteness of the test suite leaves you with no options. 10


----
## Page 155

> there are situations in which following the Three Rules is not practical.


----
## Page 158

> How do you keep functions easy to test? You decouple them. Indeed, testability is just a synonym for decoupling


----
## Page 158

> By writing the tests first, you will decouple the system in ways that you had never thought about before.


----
## Page 159

> If everyone on the team behaves this way, then the code must rot. No one will clean it. No one will improve it. Every feature added will be added in such a way as to minimize the immediate risk to the programmers.


----
## Page 163

> we migrate the code one small step at a time, while continuing to add new features during the normal Agile cycle.


----
## Page 166

> Another role option is for one programmer to write a test, and the other to make it pass and write the next test for the first programmer to pass. This is sometimes called Ping-Pong.


----
## Page 166

> Most often, however, there are no roles at all. The programmers are simply co-equal authors sharing the mouse and keyboard in a cooperative manner.


----
## Page 166

> Even pairings as short as 15 to 30 minutes can be beneficial. 11


----
## Page 167

> many teams have replaced code reviews with pairing.


----
## Page 168

> it would require 115 pairing programmers to do the same work of 100 individuals (without code reviews).


----
## Page 170

> Kent Beck named the four values of Agile long ago. They are courage, communication, feedback, and simplicity.


----
## Page 173

> The reason for this loss of productivity is the corruption and degradation of the code itself.


----
## Page 202

> Minimum Viable Increments


----
## Page 203

> Small, valuable user stories—Small, individually releasable stories limit the scope of dependencies, which simplifies multiteam coordination.


----
## Page 203

> “The increment must be in useable condition regardless of whether the Product Owner decides to release 12


----
## Page 207

> Roadmaps and milestones are being defined by managers and forced upon development teams— developers can estimate the work, but they are pushed hard to fit their estimates into the imposed milestones.


----
## Page 208

> the product owner thinks developers are spending too much time on things like automated tests, refactoring, or pairing, they simply tell the team to stop doing


----
## Page 208

> The order is to simply focus on the highest-priority item in the backlog and get it done as fast as possible—one highest-priority item after another.


----
## Page 208

> Fragile software, the famous monoliths (or distributed monoliths for the teams trying micro services) become the norm. Bugs and operational problems are popular discussion topics during daily standup meetings and retrospectives.


----
## Page 208

> Managers blame developers for not moving quickly enough. Developers blame managers for not allowing them to do the technical and strategic work needed. Product owners do not consider themselves as part of the team and do not share the responsibility when things go wrong. The us-versus- them culture reigns dominant.


----
## Page 208

> That is what we call the Agile Hangover.


----
## Page 209

> Rarely is there a budget for up-skilling developers during Agile transformations. Business does not expect developers to slow down during their Agile adoption. 13


----
## Page 210

> Business agility is directly related to how quickly companies can evolve their software, and that means an evolution in their engineering skills and technical practices.


----
## Page 210

> Over the years, developers started seeing Agile coaches as another layer of management: people telling them what to do instead of helping them to get better at what they do.


----
## Page 211

> Many Product Owners (or project managers) still do not feel they are part of the team and do not feel responsible when things do not go according to plan.


----
## Page 211

> Developers still need to negotiate hard with the business to make the necessary technical improvements to keep developing and maintaining the system.


----
## Page 211

> Companies are still not mature enough to understand that technical problems are in fact business problems.


----
## Page 215

> Instead of pushing TDD, maybe we could start agreeing on the value of reducing the time it takes to test our entire system.


----
## Page 217

> They should not have separate tasks for unit tests or refactoring.


----
## Page 217

> They are not optional. Managers and developers should only discuss what is going to be delivered and when, not how. 14


----
## Page 218

> There is a difference between having a job and having a profession.


----
## Page 218

> A profession is something we invest in. It’s something we want to get better at. We want to gain more skills and have a long-lasting and fulfilling career.


----
## Page 218

> A profession gives meaning to our lives.

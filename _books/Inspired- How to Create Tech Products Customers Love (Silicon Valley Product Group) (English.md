> It doesn't matter how good your engineering team is if they are not given something worthwhile to build.


----
## Page 2

> I discovered that there was a tremendous difference between how the best companies produced products and how most companies produced them.


----
## Page 5

> The product manager role is usually very much a full‐time assignment. I don't personally know many who are able to do what they need to do in less than 60 hours a week.


----
## Page 9

> In a startup, the product manager role is usually covered by one of the co‐founders.


----
## Page 10

> Nothing else much matters until you can come up with a strong product that meets the needs of an initial market. 2


----
## Page 10

> Working at a startup—racing toward product/market fit—is usually stressful, exhausting, and risky. But it can also be an amazingly positive experience, and if things go well, a financially rewarding one


----
## Page 18

> The truth, however, is that many product ideas end up making absolutely nothing. And that's not an exaggeration for effect. Literally nothing (we know this from A/B testing).


----
## Page 19

> The most common is that customers just aren't as excited about this idea as we are. So, they choose not to use it.


----
## Page 20

> We say if you're just using your engineers to code, you're only getting about half their value.


----
## Page 20

> Unfortunately, projects are output and product is all about outcome.


----
## Page 20

> Yes, something was finally released, but it doesn't meet its objectives so what really was the point?


----
## Page 20

> The biggest flaw of the old waterfall process has always been, and remains, that all the risk is at the end, which means that customer validation happens way too late.


----
## Page 24

> Risks are tackled up front, rather than at the end. 3


----
## Page 24

> these risks prior to deciding to build anything. These risks include value risk (whether customers will buy it), usability risk (whether users can figure out how to use it), feasibility risk (whether our engineers can build what we need with the time, skills, and technology we have), and business viability risk (whether this solution also works for the various aspects of our business—sales, marketing, finance, legal, etc.).

## Page 24

> Products are defined and designed collaboratively, rather than sequentially.


----
## Page 24

> In strong teams, product, design, and engineering work side by side,


----
## Page 24

> Finally, it's all about solving problems, not implementing features.


----
## Page 24

> They must ensure that solution solves the underlying problem. It's about business results.


----
## Page 27

> the engineers are also helping daily on discovery (and many of the best innovations come from that participation, so this is not a minor point),


----
## Page 27

> Discovery is very much about the intense collaboration of product management, user experience design, and engineering.


----
## Page 27

> The purpose of product discovery is to quickly separate the good ideas from the bad. The output of product discovery is a validated product backlog.


----
## Page 27

> Will the user buy this (or choose to use it)? Can the user figure out how to use this? Can our engineers build this? Can our stakeholders support this? 4


----
## Page 29

> The final critical concept is product vision. This refers to the longer‐term objective of this product, normally 2–10 years out.


----
## Page 33

> Missionaries are true believers in the vision and are committed to solving problems for their customers.


----
## Page 33

> typical product team is comprised of a product manager, a product designer,


----
## Page 35

> A product team is not about reporting relationships—it has an intentionally flat organizational structure.


----
## Page 35

> To be absolutely clear, the product manager is not the boss of anyone on the product team.


----
## Page 37

> Sometimes we have each team focus on a different type of user or customer.


----
## Page 42

> the strongest talent in the company. If the product manager doesn't have the technology sophistication, doesn't have the business savvy, doesn't have the credibility with the key executives, doesn't have the deep customer knowledge, doesn't have the passion for the product, or doesn't have the respect of their product team, then it's a sure recipe for failure. 5


----
## Page 42

> It's not that unusual for people to question whether they even need a product manager. If they don't design and they don't code, why bother? This is a clear sign of a company that hasn't experienced strong product management.

> or she is responsible for evaluating opportunities and determining what gets built and delivered to customers. We generally describe what needs to get built on the product backlog.


----
## Page 42

> When a product succeeds, it's because everyone on the team did what they needed to do. But when a product fails, it's the product manager's fault.


----
## Page 43

> become an acknowledged expert on the customer: their issues, pains, desires, how they think—and for business products, how they work, and how they decide to buy.


----
## Page 43

> Without this deep customer knowledge, you're just guessing.


----
## Page 44

> Most product managers start their day with half an hour or so in the analytics tools, understanding what's been happening in the past 24 hours. They're looking at sales analytics and usage analytics. They're looking at the results of A/B tests.


----
## Page 45

> Succeeding in the job of product means convincing each key stakeholder that you understand their constraints and that you are committed to only delivering solutions that you believe are consistent with those constraints.


----
## Page 45

> The fourth critical contribution is deep knowledge of the market and industry in which you're competing. 6


----
## Page 45

> This is one of the big reasons why it is not enough to have feature parity with a competitor. Rather, you need to be substantially better to motivate a user or customer to switch.


----
## Page 46

> To summarize, these are the four critical contributions you need to bring to your team: deep knowledge (1) of your customer, (2) of the data, (3) of your business and its stakeholders, and (4) of your market and industry.


----
## Page 47

> The passion for products and for solving customer problems is not something I think you can teach.


----
## Page 47

> The level of time and effort required by the product manager role is extremely tough to sustain if you're not personally passionate about your products and your role.


----
## Page 49

> Product management is absolutely distinct from the other disciplines.


----
## Page 49

> Like a CEO, the product manager must deeply understand all aspects of the business.


----
## Page 49

> In every one of these examples, the winning solutions didn't come from users, customers, or sales. Rather,


----
## Page 49

> True leadership is a big part of what separates the great product people from the merely good ones. 7


----
## Page 56

> Three situations in particular are incredibly common and serious problems:

## Page 58

> five keys to a successful and healthy relationship with your designer:


----
## Page 60

> It's also critical that you share very openly what you know about your customers—especially their pain—the data, and your business constraints. Your job is to bring this information to your team and then to discuss the various potential solutions to these problems.
